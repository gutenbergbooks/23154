<p class="center"><big>To<br />
GEORGE W. E. RUSSELL</big></p>

<p>I dedicate this Romance of Friendship to you with the
sincerest pleasure and affection. You were the first to
suggest that I should write a book about contemporary
life at Harrow; you gave me the principal idea; you have
furnished me with notes innumerable; you have revised
every page of the manuscript; and you are a peculiarly
keen Harrovian.</p>

<p>In making this public declaration of my obligations to
you, I take the opportunity of stating that the characters
in "The Hill," whether masters or boys, are not portraits,
although they may be called, truthfully enough, composite
photographs; and that the episodes of Drinking and
Gambling are founded on isolated incidents, not on habitual
practices. Moreover, in attempting to reproduce the
curious admixture of "strenuousness and sentiment"&mdash;your
own phrase&mdash;which animates so vitally Harrow life,
I have been obliged to select the less common types of
Harrovian. Only the elect are capable of such friendship
as John Verney entertained for Henry Desmond; and few
boys, happily, are possessed of such powers as Scaife is
shown to exercise. But that there are such boys as Verney
and Scaife, nobody knows better than yourself.</p>

<p class="author"><span style="margin-left: 1em;">Believe me,</span><br />

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">The train</span> slid slowly out of Harrow station.</p>

<p>Five minutes before, a man and a boy had been walking
up and down the long platform. The boy wondered why
the man, his uncle, was so strangely silent. Then, suddenly,
the elder John Verney had placed his hands upon the
shoulders of the younger John, looking down into eyes as
grey and as steady as his own.</p>

<p>"You'll find plenty of fellows abusing Harrow," he
said quietly; "but take it from me, that the fault lies not
in Harrow, but in them. Such boys, as a rule, do not come
out of the top drawer. Don't look so solemn. You're
about to take a header into a big river. In it are rocks and
rapids; but you know how to swim, and after the first
plunge you'll enjoy it, as I did, amazingly."</p>

<p>"Ra&mdash;ther," said John.</p>

<p>In the New Forest, where John had spent most of his
life at his uncle's place of Verney Boscobel, this uncle, his
dead father's only brother, was worshipped as a hero.
Indeed he filled so large a space in the boy's imagination,
that others were cramped for room. John Verney in India,
in Burmah, in Africa (he took continents in his stride),
moved colossal. And when uncle and nephew met, behold,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
the great traveller stood not much taller than John himself!
That first moment, the instant shattering of a precious
delusion, held anguish. But now, as the train whirled
away the silent, thin, little man, he began to expand again.
John saw him scaling heights, cutting a path through impenetrable
forests, wading across dismal swamps, an ever-moving
figure, seeking the hitherto unknowable and irreclaimable,
introducing order where chaos reigned supreme,
a world-famous pioneer.</p>

<p>How good to think that John Verney was <i>his</i> uncle,
blood of his blood, his, his, his&mdash;for all time!</p>

<p>And, long ago, John, senior, had come to Harrow; had
felt what John, junior, felt to the core&mdash;the dull, grinding
wrench of separation, the sense, not yet to be analysed by
a boy, of standing alone upon the edge of a river, indeed,
into which he must plunge headlong in a few minutes.
Well, Uncle John had taken his "header" with a stout
heart&mdash;who dared to doubt that? Surely he had not
waited, shivering and hesitating, at the jumping-off place.</p>

<p>The train was now out of sight. John slipped the uncle's
tip into his purse, and walked out of the station and on
to the road beyond, the road which led to the top of the
Hill.</p>

<p><i>The Hill.</i></p>

<p>Presently, the boy reached some iron palings and a
wicket-gate. His uncle had pointed out this gate and the
steep path beyond which led to the top of the Hill, to
the churchyard, to the Peachey tomb on which Byron
dreamed,<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> to the High Street&mdash;and to the Manor. It was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
pleasant to remember that he was going to board at the
Manor, with its traditions, its triumphs, its record. In his
uncle's day the Manor ranked first among the boarding-houses.
Not a doubt disturbed John's conviction that it
ranked first still.</p>

<p>The boy stared upwards with a keen gaze. Had the
mother seen her son at that moment, she might have discerned
a subtle likeness between uncle and nephew, not the
likeness of the flesh, but of the spirit.</p>

<p>September rains, followed by a day of warm sunshine,
had lured from the earth a soft haze which obscured the
big fields at the foot of the Hill. John could make out
fences, poplars, elms, Scotch firs, and spectral houses.
But, above, everything was clear. The school-buildings,
such as he could see, stood out boldly against a cloudless
sky, and above these soared the spire of Harrow Church,
pointing an inexorable finger upwards.</p>

<p>Afterwards this spot became dear to John Verney,
because here, where mists were chill and blinding, he had
been impelled to leave the broad high-road and take a path
which led into a shadowy future. In obedience to an
impulse stronger than himself he had taken the short cut
to what awaited him.</p>

<p>For a few minutes he stood outside the palings, trying
to choke down an abominable lump in his throat. This
was not his first visit to Harrow. At the end of the
previous term, he had ascended the Hill to pass the entrance
examination. A master from his preparatory school accompanied
him, an Etonian, who had stared rather superciliously&mdash;so
John thought&mdash;at buildings less venerable
than those which Henry VI raised near Windsor. John,
who had perceptions, was elusively conscious that his
companion, too much of a gentleman to give his thoughts
words, might be contrasting a yeoman's work with a king's;
and when the Etonian, gazing across the plains below to
where Windsor lay, a soft shadow upon the horizon, said
abruptly, "I wish Eton had been built upon a hill," John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>
replied effusively: "Oh, sir, it <i>is</i> decent of you to say that."
The examination, however, distracted his attention from
all things save the papers. To his delight he found these
easy, and, as soon as he left the examination-room, he was
popped into a cab and taken back to town. Coming down
the flight of steps, he had seen a few boys hurrying up or
down the road. At these the Etonian cocked a twinkling
eye.</p>

<p>"Queer kit you Harrow boys wear," he said.</p>

<p>John, inordinately grateful at this recognition of himself
as an Harrovian, forgave the gibe. It had struck him,
also, that the shallow straw hat, the swallow-tail coat, did
look queer, but he regarded them reverently as the uniform
of a crack corps.</p>

<p>To-day, standing by the iron palings, John reviewed
the events of the last hour. The view was blurred by
unshed tears. His uncle and he had driven together to
the Manor. Here, the explorer had exercised his peculiar
personal magnetism upon the house-master, a tall, burly
man of truculent aspect and speech. John realized proudly
that his uncle was the bigger of the two, and the giant
acknowledged, perhaps grudgingly, the dwarf's superiority.
The talk, short enough, had wandered into Darkest Africa.
His uncle, as usual, said little, replying almost in monosyllables
to the questions of his host; but John junior told
himself exultantly that it was not necessary for Uncle John
to talk; the wide world knew what he had done.</p>

<p>Then his house-master, Rutford, had told John where
to buy his first straw hat.</p>

<p>"You can get one without an order at the beginning of
each term," said he, in a thick, rasping voice. "But you
must ask me for an order if you want a second."</p>

<p>Then he had shown John his room, to be shared with
two other boys, and had told him the hour of lock-up.
And then, after tea, came the walk down the hill, the tip,
the firm grasp of the sinewy hand, and a final&mdash;"God
bless you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span></p>

<p>Coming to the end of these reflections, confronted by
the inexorable future, and the necessity, no less inexorable,
of stepping into it, John passed through the gate. His
heart fluttered furiously, and the lump in the throat swelled
inconveniently. John, however, had provided himself
with a "cure-all." Plunging his hand into his pocket,
he pulled out a cartridge, an unused twenty-bore gun cartridge.
Looking at this, John smiled. When he smiled he
became good-looking. The face, too long, plain, but full
of sense and humour, rounded itself into the gracious
curves of youth; the serious grey eyes sparkled; the lips,
too firmly compressed, parted, revealing admirable teeth,
small and squarely set; into the cheeks, brown rather than
pink, flowed a warm stream of colour.</p>

<p>The cartridge stood for so much. Only a week before,
Uncle John, on his arrival from Manchuria, had handed his
nephew a small leather case and a key. The case held a
double-barrelled, hammerless, ejector, twenty-bore gun,
with a great name upon its polished blue barrels.</p>

<p>The sight of the cartridge justified John's expectations.
He put it back into his pocket, and strode forward and
upward.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Close to the School Chapel, John remarked a curly-headed
young gentleman of wonderfully prepossessing
appearance, from whom emanated an air, an atmosphere,
of genial enjoyment which diffused itself. The bricks of
the school-buildings seemed redder and warmer, as if they
were basking in this sunny smile. The youth was smiling
now, smiling&mdash;at John. For several hours John had been
miserably aware that surprises awaited him, but not smiles.
He knew no Harrovians; at his school, a small one, his
fellows were labelled Winchester, Eton, Wellington; none,
curiously enough, Harrow. And already he had passed
half a dozen boys, the first-comers, some strangers, like
himself, and in each face he had read indifference. Not
one had taken the trouble to say, "Hullo! Who are<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
you?" after the rough and ready fashion of the private
school.</p>

<p>And now this smiling, fascinating person was actually
about to address him, and in the old familiar style&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hullo!"</p>

<p>"Hullo!"</p>

<p>"I met your governor the other day."</p>

<p>"Did you?" John replied. His father had died when
John was seven. Obviously, a blunder in identity had
created this genial smile. John wished that his father had
not died.</p>

<p>"Yes," pursued the smiling one, "I met him&mdash;partridge-shooting
at home&mdash;and he asked me to be on the look-out
for you. It's queer you should turn up at once, isn't
it?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John.</p>

<p>"Your governor looked awfully fit."</p>

<p>"Did he?" Then John added solemnly, "My governor
died when I was a kid."</p>

<p>The other gasped; then he threw back his curly head and
laughed.</p>

<p>"I say, I beg your pardon. I didn't mean to laugh.
If you're not Hardacre, who are you?"</p>

<p>"Verney. I've just come."</p>

<p>"Verney? That's a great Harrow name. Are you any
relation to the explorer?"</p>

<p>"Nephew," said John, blushing.</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;you ought to have been here last Speecher.<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a>
We cheered him, I can tell you. And the song was sung:
the one with his name in it."</p>

<p>"Yes," said John. Then he added nervously, "All
the same, I don't know a soul at Harrow."</p>

<p>Desmond smiled. The smile assured John that his
name would secure him a cordial welcome. Desmond<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
added abruptly, "My name, Desmond, is a Harrow name.
My father, my grandfather, my uncles, and three brothers
were here. It does make a difference. What's your
house?"</p>

<p>"The Manor," said John, proudly.</p>

<p>"Dirty Dick's!" Then, seeing consternation writ large
upon John's face, he added quickly, "We call <i>him</i> Dirty
Dick, you know; but the house is&mdash;er&mdash;one of the oldest
and biggest&mdash;er&mdash;houses." He continued hurriedly: "I'm
going into Damer's next term. Damer's is always chock-a-block,
you know."</p>

<p>"Why is Rutford called 'Dirty Dick'?" John asked
nervously. "He doesn't <i>look</i> dirty."</p>

<p>"Oh, we've licked him into a sort of shape," said
Desmond. "I <i>believe</i> he toshes now&mdash;once a month or so."</p>

<p>"Toshes?"</p>

<p>"Tubs, you know. We call a tub a 'tosh.' When
Dirty Dick came here he was unclean. He told his form&mdash;oh!
the cheek of it!&mdash;that in his filthy mind one bath
a week was plenty," unconsciously the boy mimicked the
thick, rasping tones&mdash;"two, luxury, and three&mdash;superfluity!
After that he was called Dirty Dick. There's
another story. They say that years ago he went to a
Turkish bath, and after a rare good scraping the man who
was scraping him&mdash;nasty job that!&mdash;found something which
Dirty Dick recognized as a beastly flannel shirt he had lost
when he was at the 'Varsity. But only the Fourth Form
boys swallow <i>that</i>. Hullo! There's a pal of mine. See
you again."</p>

<p>He ran off gaily. John walked to the shop where
straw hats were sold. Here he met other new boys, who
regarded him curiously, but said nothing. John put on
his hat, and gave Rutford's name to the young man who
waited on him. He had an absurd feeling that the young
man would say, "Oh yes&mdash;Dirty Dick's!" One very
nice-looking pink-cheeked boy said to another boy that he
was at Damer's. John could have sworn that the hatter's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
assistant regarded the pink youth with increased deference.
Why had Uncle John sent him to Dirty Dick's? He
hurried out of the shop, fuming. Then he remembered
the hammerless gun. After all, the Manor had been <i>the</i>
house once, and it might be <i>the</i> house again.</p>

<p>By this time the boys were arriving. Groups were
forming. Snatches of chatter reached John's ears. "Yes,
I shot a stag, a nine-pointer. My governor is going to have
it set up for me&mdash;&mdash; What? Walked up your grouse
with dogs! We drive ours&mdash;&mdash; I had some ripping cricket,
made a century in one match&mdash;&mdash; By Jove! Did you
really?&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>John passed on. These were "bloods," tremendous
swells, grown men with a titillating flavour of the world
about their distinguished persons.</p>

<p>A minute later he was staring disconsolately at a group
of his fellows just in front of Dir&mdash;&mdash;of Rutford's side door.
An impulse seized him to turn and flee. What would
Uncle John say to that? So he advanced. The boys
made way politely, asking no questions. As he passed
through he caught a few eager words. "I was hoping that
the brute had gone. It <i>is</i> a sickener, and no mistake!"</p>

<p>John ascended the battered, worn-out staircase, wondering
who the "brute" was. Perhaps a sort of Flashman.
John knew his <i>Tom Brown</i>; but some one had told him
that bullying had ceased to be. Great emphasis had been
laid on the "brute," whoever he might be.</p>

<p>Upon the second-floor passage, he found his room and
one of its tenants, who nodded carelessly as John crossed
the threshold.</p>

<p>"I'm Scaife," he said. "Are you the Lord, or the
Commoner?" He laughed, indicating a large portmanteau,
labelled, "Lord Esm&eacute; Kinloch."</p>

<p>"I'm Verney," said John.</p>

<p>"I've bagged the best bed," said Scaife, after a pause,
"and I advise you to bag the next best one, over there.
It was mine last term."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span></p>

<p>"I don't see the beds," said John, staring about him.</p>

<p>Scaife pointed out what appeared to be three tall,
narrow wardrobes. The rest of the furniture included
three much-battered washstands and chests of drawers,
four Windsor chairs, and a square table, covered with
innumerable inkstains and roughly-carved names.</p>

<p>"The beds let down," Scaife said, "and during the first
school the maids make them, and shut them up again. It
is considered a joke to crawl into another fellow's room at
night, and shut him up. You find yourself standing upon
your head in the dark, choking. It is a joke&mdash;for the other
fellow."</p>

<p>"Did some one do that to you?" asked John.</p>

<p>"Yes; a big lout in the Third Fifth," Scaife smiled
grimly.</p>

<p>"And what did you do?"</p>

<p>"I waited for him next day with a cricket stump.
There was an awful row, because I let him have it a bit
too hard; but I've not been shut up since. That bed is
a beast. It collapses." He chuckled. "Young Kinloch
won't find it quite as soft as the ones at White Ladies.
Well, like the rest of us, he'll have to take Dirty Dick's as
he finds it."</p>

<p>The bolt had fallen.</p>

<p>John asked in a quavering voice, "Then it <i>is</i> called
that?"</p>

<p>"Called what?"</p>

<p>"This house. Dirty Dick's!"</p>

<p>Scaife smiled cynically. He looked about a year older
than John, but he had the air and manners of a man of the
world&mdash;so John thought. Also, he was very good-looking,
handsomer than Desmond, and in striking contrast to that
smiling, genial youth, being dark, almost swarthy of complexion,
with strongly-marked features and rather coarse
hands and feet.</p>

<p>"Everybody here calls it Dirty Dick's," he replied
curtly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span></p>

<p>John stared helplessly.</p>

<p>"But," he muttered, "I heard, I was told, that the
Manor was the best house in the school."</p>

<p>"It used to be," Scaife answered. "To-day, it comes
jolly near being the worst. The fellows in other houses are
decent; they don't rub it in; but, between ourselves, the
Manor has gone to pot ever since Dirty Dick took hold of
it. Damer's is the swell house now."</p>

<p>John began to unstrap his portmanteau. Scaife puzzled
him. For instance, he displayed no curiosity. He did not
put the questions always asked at a Preparatory School.
Without turning his thought into words, John divined that
at Harrow it was bad form to ask questions. As he wanted
to ask a question, a very important question, this enforced
silence became exasperating.</p>

<p>Presently Scaife said, "I suppose you are one of the
Claydon lot."</p>

<p>"No; my home is in the New Forest. My uncle is
Verney of Verney Boscobel."</p>

<p>"Oh! his name is on the panels at the head of the
staircase; and it's carved on a bed in the next room."</p>

<p>"Crikey! I must go and look at it."</p>

<p>"You can look at the panels, of course; but don't say
'Crikey!' and don't go into the next room. Two Fifth
Form fellows have it. It would be infernal cheek."</p>

<p>John hoped that Scaife would offer to accompany him
to the panels. Then he went alone. It being now within
half an hour of lock-up, the passages were swarming with
boys. Soon John would see them assembled in Hall, where
their names would be called over by Rutford. Everybody&mdash;John
had been told&mdash;was expected to be present at this
first call-over, except a few boys who might be coming from
a distance. John worked his way along the upper passage,
and down the second flight of stairs till he came to the first
landing. Here, close to the house notice-board, were some
oak panels covered with names and dates, all carved&mdash;so
John learned later&mdash;by a famous Harrow character, Sam<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
Hoare, once "Custos" of the School. The boy glanced
eagerly, ardently, up and down the panels. Ah, yes, here
was his father's name, and here&mdash;his uncle's. And then
out of the dull, finely-grained oak, shone other names
familiar to all who love the Hill and its traditions. John's
heart grew warm again with pride in the house that had
held such men. The name of the great statesman and below
it a mighty warrior's made him thrill and tremble. They
were <i>Old Harrovians</i>, these fellows, men whom his uncle had
known, men of whom his dear mother, wise soul! had
spoken a thousand times. The landing and the passages
were roaring with the life of the present moment. Boys,
big and small, were chaffing each other loudly. Under
some circumstances, this new-comer, a stranger, ignored
entirely, might have felt desolate and forlorn in the heart
of such a crowd; but John was tingling with delight and
pleasure.</p>

<p>Suddenly, the noise moderated. John, looking up, saw
a big fellow slowly approaching, exchanging greetings with
everybody. John turned to a boy close to him.</p>

<p>"Who is it?" he whispered.</p>

<p>The other boy answered curtly, "Lawrence, the Head
of the House."</p>

<p>The big fellow suddenly caught John's eyes. What he
read there&mdash;admiration, respect, envy&mdash;brought a slight
smile to his lips.</p>

<p>"Your name?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"Verney."</p>

<p>Lawrence held out his hand, simply and yet with a
certain dignity.</p>

<p>"I heard you were coming," he said, keenly examining
John's face. "We can't have too many Verneys. If I
can do anything for you, let me know."</p>

<p>He nodded, and strode on. John saw that several boys
were staring with a new interest. None, however, spoke to
him; and he returned to his room with a blushing face.
Scaife had unpacked his clothes and put them away; he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
was now surveying the bare walls with undisguised contempt.</p>

<p>"Isn't this a beastly hole?" he remarked.</p>

<p>John, always interested in people rather than things,
examined the room carefully. Passing down the passage
he had caught glimpses of other rooms: some charmingly
furnished, gay with chintz, embellished with pictures,
Japanese fans, silver cups, and other trophies. Comparing
these with his own apartment, John said shyly&mdash;</p>

<p>"It's not very beefy."</p>

<p>"Beefy? You smell of a private school, Verney. Now,
is it worth doing up? You see, I shall be in a two-room
next term. If we all chip in&mdash;&mdash;" he paused.</p>

<p>"I've brought back two quid," said John.</p>

<p>Scaife's smile indicated neither approval nor the reverse.
John's ingenuous confidence provoked none in
return.</p>

<p>"We'll talk about it when Kinloch arrives. I wonder
why his people sent him here."</p>

<p>John had studied some books, but not the Peerage.
The great name of Kinloch was new to him, not new to
Scaife, who, for a boy, knew his "Burke" too odiously well.</p>

<p>"Why shouldn't his people send him here?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Because," Scaife's tone was contemptuous, "because
the Kinlochs&mdash;they're a great cricketing family&mdash;go to
Eton. The duke must have some reason."</p>

<p>"The duke?"</p>

<p>"Hang it, surely you have heard of the Duke of Trent?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John, humbly. "And this is his son?"
He glanced at the label on the new portmanteau.</p>

<p>"Whose son should he be?" said Scaife. "Well, it's
queer. Dukes<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> and dukes' sons come to Harrow&mdash;all the
Hamiltons were here, and the FitzRoys, and the St. Maurs&mdash;but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
the Kinlochs, as I say, have gone to Eton. It's a
rum thing&mdash;very. And why the deuce hasn't he turned
up?"</p>

<p>The clanging of a bell brought both boys to their feet.</p>

<p>"Lock-up, and call-over," said Scaife. "Come on!"</p>

<p>They pushed their way down the passage. Several
boys addressed Scaife.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Demon!&mdash;Here's the old Demon!&mdash;Demon, I
thought you were going to be sacked!"</p>

<p>To these and other sallies Scaife replied with his slightly
ironical smile. John perceived that his companion was
popular and at the same time peculiar; quite different
from any boy he had yet met.</p>

<p>They filed into a big room&mdash;the dining-room of the
house&mdash;a square, lofty hall, with three long tables in it.
On the walls hung some portraits of famous Old Harrovians.
As a room it was disappointing at first sight,
almost commonplace. But in it, John soon found out,
everything for weal or woe which concerned the Manor
had taken place or had been discussed. There were two
fireplaces and two large doors. The boys passed through
one door; upon the threshold of the other stood the butler,
holding a silver salver, with a sheet of paper on it.</p>

<p>"What cheek!" murmured Scaife.</p>

<p>"Eh?" said John.</p>

<p>"Dirty Dick isn't here. Just like him, the slacker!
And when he does come over on our side of the House,
he slimes about in carpet slippers&mdash;the beast!"</p>

<p>Lawrence entered as Scaife spoke. John saw that his
strongly-marked eyebrows went up, when he perceived the
butler. He approached, and took the sheet of paper.
The butler said impressively&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Rutford is busy. Will you call over, sir?"</p>

<p>At any rate, the butler, Dumbleton, was worthy of the
best traditions of the Manor. He had a shrewd, clean-shaven
face, and the deportment of an archbishop. The
Head of the House took the paper, and began to call over<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
the names. Each boy, as his name was called, said, "Here,"
or, if he wished to be funny, "Here, <i>sir</i>!"</p>

<p>"Verney?"</p>

<p>The name rang out crisply.</p>

<p>"Here, <i>sir</i>," said John.</p>

<p>The Head of the House eyed him sharply.</p>

<p>"Kinloch?"</p>

<p>No answer.</p>

<p>"Kinloch?"</p>

<p>Scaife answered dryly: "Kinloch's portmanteau has
come." Then Dumbleton said in his smooth, bland voice,
"His lordship is in the drawing-room with Mr. Rutford."</p>

<p>The boys exchanged knowing glances. Scaife looked
contemptuous. The next moment the last name had been
called, and the boys scurried into the passages. Lawrence
was the first to leave the hall. Impulsively, John rushed
up to him.</p>

<p>"I didn't mean to be funny, I didn't really," he panted.</p>

<p>"Quite right. It doesn't pay," Lawrence smiled grimly,
"for new boys to be funny. I saw you didn't mean it."</p>

<p>Lawrence spoke in a loud voice. John realized that
he had so spoken purposely, trying to wipe out a new boy's
first blunder.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," said John.</p>

<p>He reached his room to find three other boys busily
engaged in abusing their house-master. They took no
notice of John, who leaned against the wall.</p>

<p>"His lordship is in the drawing-room with Mr. Rutford."</p>

<p>A freckle-faced, red-headed youth, with a big elastic
mouth had imitated Dumbleton admirably.</p>

<p>"What a snob Dick is!" drawled a very tall, very thin,
aristocratic-looking boy.</p>

<p>"And a fool," added Scaife. "This sort of thing makes
him loathed."</p>

<p>"It <i>is</i> a sell his being here."</p>

<p>All three fell to talking. The question still festering in
John's mind was answered within a minute. The "brute"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was Rutford. Towards the end of the previous term
gossip had it that the master of the Manor had been offered
an appointment elsewhere. Whereat the worthier spirits
in the ancient house rejoiced. Now the joy was turned into
wailing and gnashing of teeth.</p>

<p>"Is he a beast to <i>us</i>?" said John.</p>

<p>The freckle-faced boy answered affably, "That depends.
His Imperial Highness"&mdash;he kicked the new portmanteau
hard&mdash;"will not find Mr. Richard Rutford a beast. Far
from it. And he's civil to the Demon, because his papa is
a man of many shekels. But to mere outsiders, like myself, a
beast of beasts; ay, the very king of beasts, is&mdash;Dirty Dick."</p>

<p>And then&mdash;oh, horrors!&mdash;the door of No. 15 opened,
and Rutford appeared, followed by a seemingly young and
very fashionably dressed lady. The boys jumped to their
feet. All, except Scaife, looked preternaturally solemn.
The house-master nodded carelessly.</p>

<p>"This is Scaife, Duchess," he said in his thick, rasping
tones. "Scaife and Verney, let me present you to the
Duchess of Trent."</p>

<p>He mouthed the illustrious name, as if it were a large
and ripe greengage.</p>

<p>The duchess advanced, smiling graciously. "These"&mdash;Rutford
named the other boys&mdash;"are Egerton, Lovell,
and&mdash;er&mdash;Duff."</p>

<p>Scaife, alone of those present, appreciated the order in
which his schoolfellows had been named. Egerton&mdash;known
as the Caterpillar&mdash;was the son of a Guardsman; Lovell's
father was a judge; Duff's father an obscure parson.</p>

<p>The duchess shook hands with each boy. "Your father
and I are old friends," she said to Egerton; "and I have
had the pleasure of meeting your uncle," she smiled at John.</p>

<p>Duff looked unhappy and ill at ease, because it was
almost certain that his last sentence had been overheard by
the house-master. The duchess asked a few questions and
then took her leave. She and her son were dining with the
Head Master. Rutford accompanied her.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did the blighter hear?" said Duff.</p>

<p>"How could he help it with his enormous asses' ears?"
said the tall, thin Egerton.</p>

<p>Duff, an optimist, like all red-headed, freckled boys,
appealed to the others, each in turn. The verdict was
unanimous.</p>

<p>"He hates me like poison," said Duff. "I shall catch
it hot. What an unlucky beggar I am!"</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Scaife. "He knows jolly well that the
whole school calls him Dirty Dick."</p>

<p>But whatever hopes Duff may have entertained of his
house-master's deafness were speedily laid in the dust.
Within five minutes Rutford reappeared. He stood in the
doorway, glaring.</p>

<p>"Just now, Duff," said he, "I happened to overhear
your voice, which is singularly, I may say vulgarly, penetrating.
You were speaking of me, your house-master, as
'Dick.' But you used an adjective before it. What was it?"</p>

<p>Duff writhed. "I don't&mdash;remember."</p>

<p>"Oh yes, you do. Why lie, Duff?"</p>

<p>John's brown face grew pale.</p>

<p>"The adjective you used," continued Rutford, "was
'dirty.' You spoke of <i>me</i> as 'Dirty Dick,' and I fancy I
caught the word 'beast.' You will write out, if you please,
one hundred Greek lines, accents and stops, and bring them
to me, or leave them with Dumbleton, <i>twenty-five</i> lines at a
time, <i>every</i> alternate half hour during the afternoon of the
next half holiday. Good night to you."</p>

<p>"Good night, sir," said all the boys, save John and
Scaife.</p>

<p>"Good night, Verney."</p>

<p>Master and pupil confronted each other. John's face
looked impassive; and Rutford turned from the new boy
to Scaife.</p>

<p>"Good night, Scaife."</p>

<p>Scaife drew himself up, and, in a quiet, cool voice,
replied<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good night, sir."</p>

<p>Duff waited till Rutford's heavy step was no longer
heard; then he rushed at John.</p>

<p>"I say," he spluttered, "you're a good sort&mdash;ain't he,
Demon? Refusing to say 'Good night' to the beast
because he was ragging me. But he'll never forgive you&mdash;never!"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, he will," said Scaife. "It won't be difficult
for Dirty Dick to forgive the future Verney of Verney
Boscobel."</p>

<p>John stared. "Verney Boscobel?" he repeated.
"Why, that belongs to my uncle. Mother and I hope
he'll marry and have a lot of jolly kids of his own."</p>

<p>"You hope he'll marry? Well, I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>John's jaw stuck out. The emphasis on the "hope"
and the upraised eyebrow smote hard.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say," he began hotly, "you don't
<i>think</i> that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I can think what I please," said Scaife, curtly; "and
so can you." He laughed derisively. "<i>Thinking</i> what they
please is about the only liberty allowed to new boys. Even
the Duffer learned to hold his tongue during his first
term."</p>

<p>The Caterpillar&mdash;the tall, thin, aristocratic boy&mdash;spoke
solemnly. He was a dandy, the understudy&mdash;as John soon
discovered&mdash;of one of the "Bloods"; a "Junior Blood,"
or "Would-be," a tremendous authority on "swagger," a
stickler for tradition, who had been nearly three years in
the school.</p>

<p>"The Demon is right," said he. "A new boy can't be
too careful, Verney. Your being funny in hall just now
made a dev'lish bad impression."</p>

<p>"But I didn't mean to be funny. I told Lawrence so
directly after call-over."</p>

<p>The Caterpillar pulled down his cuffs.</p>

<p>"If you didn't mean to be funny," he concluded, "you
must be an ass."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Duff, however, remembered that John was nephew to
an explorer.</p>

<p>"I say," he jogged John's elbow, "do you think you
could get me your uncle's autograph?"</p>

<p>"Why, of course," said John.</p>

<p>"Thanks. I've not a bad collection," the Duffer
murmured modestly.</p>

<p>"And the gem of it," said Scaife, "is Billington's, the
hangman! The Duffer shivers whenever he looks at it."</p>

<p>"Yes, I do," said Duff, grinning horribly.</p>

<p>After supper and Prayers, John went to bed, but not to
sleep for at least an hour. He lay awake, thinking over
the events of this memorable day. Whenever he closed
his eyes he beheld two objects: the spire of Harrow Church
and the vivid, laughing face of Desmond. He told himself
that he liked Desmond most awfully. And Scaife too, the
Demon, had been kind. But somehow John did not like
Scaife. Then, in a curious half-dreamy condition, not yet
asleep and assuredly not quite awake, he seemed to see the
figure of Scaife expanding, assuming terrific proportions,
impending over Desmond, standing between him and the
spire, obscuring part of the spire at first, and then, bit by
bit, overshadowing the whole.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">John never</span> forgot that memorable morning when he
learned for the first time what place he had taken in the
school. He sat with the other new-comers, staring, open-eyed,
at nearly six hundred boys, big and small, assembled
together in the Speech-room. So engrossed was he that
he scarcely heard the Head Master's opening prayers.
John was obsessed, inebriated, with the number of Harrovians,
each of whom had once felt strange and shy like
himself. From his place close to the great organ, he could
look up and up, seeing row after row of faces, knowing that
amongst them sat his future friends and foes.</p>

<p>Suddenly, a neighbour nudged him. The Head Master
was reading from a list in his hand the school-removes, and
the names and places taken by new boys. He began at
the lowest form with the name of a small urchin sitting
near John. The urchin blinked and blushed as he realized
that he was "lag of the school." John knew that he had
answered fairly well the questions set by the examiners;
he had no fear of finding himself pilloried in the Third
Fourth; still, as form after form did not include his name,
he grew restless and excited. Had he taken a higher place<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>
than the Middle Shell? Yes; no Verney in the Middle
Shell. The Head Master began the removes of the top
Shell. Now, now it must be coming. No; the clear,
penetrating tones slowly articulated name after name, but
not his.</p>

<p>"Verney."</p>

<p>At last. Many eyes were staring at him, some enviously,
a few superciliously. John had taken the Lower Remove,
the highest form but one open to new boys. He was
sipping the wine called Success.</p>

<p>Moreover, Desmond of the frank, laughing face and
sparkling blue eyes, and Scaife and Egerton were also in
the Lower Remove.</p>

<p>After this, John sat in a blissful dream, hardly conscious
of his surroundings, seeing his mother's face, hearing her
sigh of pleasure when she learned that already her son was
halfway up the school.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>You may be sure those first forty-eight hours were
brim-full of excitements. First, John bought his books,
stout leather-tipped, leather-backed volumes, on which his
name will be duly stamped on fly-leaf and across the edges
of the pages. And he bought also, from "Judy" Stephens,<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
a "squash" racquet, "squash" balls, and a yard ball.
From the school Custos&mdash;"Titchy"&mdash;a noble supply of
stationery was procured. Moreover, young Kinloch announced
that his mother had given him three pounds to
spend upon the decoration of No. 15, so Scaife declared his
intention of spending a similar sum, and in consequence
No. 15 became a gorgeous apartment, the cynosure of every
eye that passed. The characters of the three boys were
revealed plainly enough by their simple furnishings. Scaife
bought sporting prints, a couple of D&eacute;taille's lithographs,
and an easy-chair, known to dwellers upon the Hill as a
"frowst"; Kinloch hung upon his side of the wall four
pretty reproductions of French engravings, and with the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
help of three yards of velveteen and some cheap lace he
made a very passable imitation of the mantel-cover in his
mother's London boudoir; John scorned velveteen, lace,
"frowsts," and French engravings. He put his money
into a pair of red curtains, and one excellent photogravure
of Landseer's "Children of the Mist." Having a few
shillings to spare, he bought half a dozen ferns, which were
placed in a box by the window, and watered so diligently
that they died prematurely.</p>

<p>Secondly, John played in a house-game at football, and
learned the difference between a scrimmage at a small
preparatory school and the genuine thing at Harrow.
Lawrence insisted that all new boys should play, and the
Caterpillar informed him that he would have to learn the
rules of Harrow "footer" by heart, and pass a stiff examination
in them before the House Eleven, with the penalty
of being forced to sing them in Hall if he failed to satisfy
his examiners. The Duffer lent him a House-shirt of green
and white stripes, and a pair of white duck shorts, and
with what pride John put them on, thinking of the far
distant day when he would wear a "fez"<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> instead of
the commonplace house-cap! Lawrence said a few
words.</p>

<p>"You'll have to play the compulsory games, Verney,
which begin after the Goose Match,<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> but I want to see you
playing as hard as ever you can in the house-games. You'll
be knocked about a bit; but a Verney won't mind that&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Rather not," said John, feeling very valiant.</p>

<p>Thirdly, there was the first Sunday, and the first sermon
of the Head Master, with its plain teaching about the
opportunities and perils of Public School life. John found
himself mightily affected by the singing, and the absence of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
shrill treble voices. The booming basses and baritones of
the big fellows made him shiver with a curious bitter-sweet
sensation never experienced before.</p>

<p>Lastly, the pleasant discovery that his Form treated
him with courtesy and kindness. Desmond, in particular,
welcomed him quite warmly. And then and there John's
heart was filled with a wild and unreasonable yearning for
this boy's friendship. But Desmond&mdash;he was called
"C&aelig;sar," because his Christian names were Henry Julius&mdash;seemed
to be very popular, a bright particular star, far
beyond John's reach although for ever in his sight. C&aelig;sar
never offered to walk with him: and he refused John's
timid invitation to have food at the "Tudor Creameries."<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
Was it possible that a boy about to enter Damer's would
not be seen walking and talking with a fellow out of Dirty
Dick's? This possibility festered, till one morning John
saw his idol walking up and down the School Yard with
Scaife. That evening he said to Scaife&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you like Desmond?"</p>

<p>"Yes," Scaife replied decisively. "I like him better
than any fellow at Harrow. You know that his father is
Charles Desmond&mdash;the Cabinet Minister and a Governor of
the school?"</p>

<p>"I didn't know it. I suppose C&aelig;sar Desmond likes
you&mdash;<i>awfully</i>."</p>

<p>"Do you? I doubt it."</p>

<p>No more was said. John told himself that C&aelig;sar&mdash;he
liked to think of Desmond as C&aelig;sar&mdash;could pick and choose
a pal out of at least three hundred boys, half the school.
How extremely unlikely that he, John, would be chosen!
But every night he lay awake for half an hour longer than
he ought to have done, wondering how, by hook or crook,
he could do a service to C&aelig;sar which must challenge interest
and provoke, ultimately, friendship.</p>

<p>Meantime, he was slowly initiated by the Caterpillar
into Harrow ways and customs. Fagging, which began<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>
after the first fortnight, he found a not unpleasant duty.
After first and fourth schools the other fags and he would
stand not far from the pantry, and yell out "Breakfast,"
or "Tea," as it might be, "for Number So-and-So."
Perhaps one had to nip up to the Creameries to get a slice
of salmon, or cutlets, or sausages. Fagging at Harrow&mdash;which
varies slightly in different houses&mdash;is hard or easy
according to the taste and fancy of the fag's master. Some
of the Sixth Form at the Manor made their fags unlace
their dirty football boots. Kinloch, who since he left the
nursery had been waited upon by powdered footmen six
feet high, now found, to his disgust, that he had to varnish
Trieve's patent-leathers for Sunday. Trieve was second in
command, and had been known as "Miss" Trieve. John
would have gladly done this and more for Lawrence, his
fag-master; but Lawrence, a manly youth, scorned sybaritic
services. The Caterpillar taught John to carry his umbrella
unfolded, to wear his "straw" straight (a slight list to port
was allowed to "Bloods" only), not to walk in the middle
of the road, and so forth. How he used to envy the members
of the Elevens as they rolled arm-in-arm down the High
Street! How often he wondered if the day would ever
dawn when C&aelig;sar and he, outwardly and inwardly linked
together, would stroll up and down the middle-walk below
the Chapel Terrace: that sunny walk, whence, on a fair
day, you can see the insatiable monster, London, filling the
horizon and stretching red, reeking hands into the sweet
country&mdash;the middle-walk, from which all but Bloods were
rigidly excluded.</p>

<p>Much to his annoyance&mdash;an annoyance, be it said, which
he managed to hide&mdash;John seemed to attract young Kinloch
almost as magnetically as he himself was attracted to C&aelig;sar.
John had not the heart to shake off the frail, delicate child,
who was christened "Fluff" after his first appearance in
public. Fluff had taken the First Fourth and ingenuously
confessed to any one who cared to listen that he ought to
have gone to Eton. A beast of a doctor prescribed the Hill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
And even the almighty duke failed to get him into Damer's,
another grievance. He had been entered since birth
at the crack house at Eton; and now to be pitchforked
into Dirty Dick's at Harrow&mdash;&mdash;! The Duffer kicked him,
feeling an unspeakable cad when poor Fluff burst into
tears.</p>

<p>"Sorry," said the Duffer. "Only you mustn't slang
Harrow. And you'd better get it into your silly head that
it's the best school in this or any other world&mdash;isn't it,
Demon?"</p>

<p>"I'm sure the Verneys, and the Egertons, and the Duffs
have always thought so."</p>

<p>"But it isn't really," whimpered poor Fluff. "You
fellows know that everybody talks of Eton and Harrow.
Who ever heard of Harrow and Eton? People say&mdash;I've
heard my eldest brother, Strathpeffer, say it again and again&mdash;'Eton
and Harrow,' just as they say 'Gentlemen and
Players.'"</p>

<p>"Oh," said the Caterpillar. "The Etonians are the
gentlemen&mdash;eh? Well, Fluff, after their performance at
Lord's last year, you couldn't expect us to admit that they're&mdash;players."</p>

<p>The Duffer chuckled.</p>

<p>"I say, Caterpillar, that was a good 'un."</p>

<p>"Not mine," said the Caterpillar, solemnly; "my
governor's, you know."</p>

<p>The Duffer continued: "Now, Fluff, I won't touch your
body, because you might tumble to pieces, but if I hear you
slanging the school or our house, I'll pull out handfuls of
fluff. D'ye hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Fluff, meekly.</p>

<p>"Say '<i>Floreat Herga</i>' on your bended knees!"</p>

<p>Fluff obeyed.</p>

<p>"And remember," said the Duffer, impressively, "that
we've had a king here, haven't we, Caterpillar?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>"I never believed it," said Scaife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span></p>

<p>"He was a Spaniard,<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> or an Italian, you know," the
Duffer explained. "The duke of something or t'other;
and an ambassador came down and offered the beggar the
Spanish crown, when he was in the First Fourth, and of
course he gobbled it&mdash;who wouldn't? And then Victor
Emmanuel interfered. That's all true, you can take your
Bible oath, because my governor told me so, and he&mdash;well,
he's a parson."</p>

<p>"Then it <i>must</i> be true," said Scaife. "Now, young
Fluff, don't forget that Harrow is a school fit for a king
and nearer to Heaven than Eton by at least six hundred
feet."</p>

<p>So saying, the Demon marched out of the room, followed
by Fluff, slightly limping.</p>

<p>"Sorry I turfed<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> that little ass so hard," said the Duffer
to John. "I say, Verney, the Demon is rather a rum 'un,
ain't he? Sometimes I can't quite make him out. He's
frightfully clever and all that, but I had a sort of beastly
feeling just now that he didn't&mdash;eh?&mdash;quite mean what he
said. Was he laughin' at <i>us</i>, pullin' our legs&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>John's brain worked slowly, as he had found out to his
cost under a form-master who maintained that it was no
use having a fact stored in the head unless it slipped readily
out of the mouth. The Duffer, who never thought, because
speaking was so much easier, grew impatient at John's
silence.</p>

<p>"Well, you needn't look like an owl, Verney. You
know that Scaife's grandfather was a navvy."</p>

<p>"I don't know," John replied.</p>

<p>"And I don't care," said the Duffer. "Let's go and
have some food at the Creameries."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Looking back afterwards, John often wondered whether,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
unconsciously, the Duffer had sown a grain of mustard-seed
destined to grow into a large tree. Or, had the intuition
that Scaife was other than what he seemed furnished
the fertile soil into which the seed fell? In any case, from
the end of this first week began to increase the suspicion,
which eventually became conviction, that the Demon,
keen at games, popular in his house, clever at work&mdash;clever,
indeed! inasmuch as he never achieved more or less than
was necessary&mdash;generous with his money, handsome and
well-mannered, blessed, in fine, with so many gifts of the
gods, yet lacked a soul.</p>

<p>This, of course, is putting into words the vague speculations
and reasonings of a boy not yet fourteen. If an
Olympian&mdash;one of the masters, for instance, or the Head
of the House&mdash;had said, "Verney, has the Demon a soul?"
John would have answered promptly, "Ra&mdash;ther! He's
been awfully decent to Fluff and me. We'd have had a hot
time if it hadn't been for him," and so forth.... And,
indeed, to doubt Scaife's sincerity and goodness seemed at
times gross disloyalty, because he stood, firm as a rock,
between the two urchins in his room and the turbulent
crowd outside. This defence of the weak, this guarding of
green fruit from the maw of Lower School boys, afforded
Scaife an opportunity of exercising power. He had the
instincts of the potter, inherited, no doubt; and he moulded
the clay ready to his hand with the delight of a master-workman.
Nobody else knew what the man of millions
had said to his boy when he despatched him to Harrow;
but the Demon remembered every word. He had reason
to respect and fear his sire.</p>

<p>"I'm sending you to Harrow to study, not books nor
games, but boys, who will be men when you are a man.
And, above all, study their weaknesses. Look for the
flaws. Teach yourself to recognize at a glance the liar,
the humbug, the fool, the egotist, and the mule. Make
friends with as many as are likely to help you in after life,
and don't forget that one enemy may inflict a greater<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
injury than twenty friends can repair. Spend money
freely; dress well; swim with the tide, not against it."</p>

<p>A year at Harrow confirmed Scaife's confidence in his
father's worldly wisdom. Big for his age, strong, with his
grandsire's muscles, tough as hickory, he had become the
leader of the Lower School boys at the Manor. The Fifth
were civil to him, recognizing, perhaps, the expediency of
leaving him alone ever since the incident of the cricket
stump. The Sixth found him the quickest of the fags and
uncommonly obliging. His house-master signed reports
which neither praised nor blamed. To Dirty Dick the boy
was the son of a man who could write a cheque for a
million.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Two things worthy of record happened within a month;
the one of lesser importance can be set down first. Charles
Desmond, C&aelig;sar's father, came down to Harrow and gave
a luncheon at the King's Head. From time immemorial
the Desmonds had been educated on the Hill. The family
had produced some famous soldiers, a Lord Chancellor, and
a Prime Minister. In the Fourth Form Room the stranger
may read their names carved in oak, and they are carved
also in the hearts of all ardent Harrovians. Mr. Desmond,
though a Cabinet Minister, found time to visit Harrow once
at least in each term. He always chose a whole holiday,
and after attending eleven-o'clock Bill<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> in the Yard, would
carry off his son and his son's friends. The School knew
him and loved him. To the thoughtful he stood for the
illustrious past, the epitome of what John Lyon's<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> boys
had fought for and accomplished. Four sons had he&mdash;Harrovians
all. Of these C&aelig;sar was youngest and last.
Each had distinguished himself on the Hill either in work
or play, or in both.</p>

<p>Charles Desmond stood upon the step just above the
master who was calling Bill.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span></p>

<p>"That's C&aelig;sar's father," said Scaife. "I'm going to
lunch with him. Isn't he a topper?"</p>

<p>John's eyes were popping out of his face. He had never
seen any man like this resplendent, stately personage,
smiling and nodding to the biggest fellows in the school.</p>

<p>"And my governor says," Scaife added, "that he's not
a rich man, nothing much to speak of in the way of income
over and above his screw as a Cabinet Minister."</p>

<p>Scaife moved away, and John could hear him say to
another boy, in an easy, friendly tone, "Mr. Desmond told
C&aelig;sar that he wanted to meet <i>me</i>&mdash;very civil of him&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>Presently John was in line waiting to pass by the steps.</p>

<p>"Verney?"</p>

<p>"Here, sir."</p>

<p>He was hurrying by, with a backward glance at the
great man. Suddenly C&aelig;sar's father beckoned, nodding
cheerily. John ascended the steps, to feel the grasp of a
strong hand, to hear a ringing voice.</p>

<p>"You're John Verney's nephew. Just so. I think I
should have spotted you, even if Harry had not told me
you were in his form. You must lunch with us. Cut
along, now."</p>

<p>So John was dismissed, brim-full of happiness, which
almost overflowed when C&aelig;sar met him with an eager&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm so glad, Verney. I say, the governor's a nailer
at picking out the old names, isn't he?"</p>

<p>So John ate his luncheon in distinguished company,
and felt himself for the first time to be somebody. As the
youngest guest present, to him was accorded the place of
honour, next the most charming host in Christendom, who
put him at ease in a jiffy. How good the cutlets and the
pheasant tasted! And how the talk warmed the cockles
of his heart! The brand of the Crossed Arrows shone
upon all topics. Who could expect, or desire, aught else!
C&aelig;sar's governor seemed to know what every Harrovian
had done worth the doing. Easily, fluently, he discoursed
of triumphs won at home, abroad, in the camp, on the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
hustings, at the bar, in the pulpit. And his anecdotes,
which illustrated every phase of life, how pat to the moment
they were! One boy complained ruefully of having spent
three terms under a form-master who had "ragged" him.
Charles Desmond sympathized&mdash;</p>

<p>"Bless my soul," said he, "don't I remember being
three terms in the Third Fifth when that tartar old Heriot
had it? I dare swear I got no more than my deserts. I
was an idle vagabond, but Heriot made my life such a
burden to me that I entreated my people to take me away
from Harrow. And then my governor urged me to put
my back into the work and get a remove. And I did.
And would you believe it, upon the first day of the next
term I wired to my people, 'You must take me away.
I've got my remove all right&mdash;and so has Heriot.'"</p>

<p>How gaily the speaker led the laugh which followed
this recital! And the chaff! Was it possible that C&aelig;sar
dared to chaff a man who was supposed to have the peace
of Europe in his keeping? And, by Jove! C&aelig;sar could
hold his own.</p>

<p>So the minutes flew. But John noticed, with surprise,
that the Demon didn't score. In fact, John and he were
the only guests that contributed nothing to the feast save
hearty appetites. It was strange that the Demon, the wit
of his house and form, never opened his mouth except to
fill it with food. He answered, it is true, and very modestly,
the questions addressed to him by his host; but then, as
John reflected, any silly fool in the Fourth Form could
do that.</p>

<p>After luncheon, the boys were dismissed, each with a
hearty word of encouragement and half a sovereign. John
was passing the plate-glass splendours of the Creameries,
when the Demon overtook him, and they walked down the
winding High Street together. Scaife had never walked
with John before.</p>

<p>"That was worth while," Scaife said quietly. John
could not interpret this speech, save in its obvious meaning.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rather," he replied.</p>

<p>"Why?" said Scaife, very sharply.</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"Why was it worth while?"</p>

<p>John stammered out something about good food and
jolly talk.</p>

<p>"Pooh!" said Scaife, contemptuously. "I thought
you had brains, Verney." He glanced at him keenly.
"Now, speak out. What's in that head of yours? You
can be cheeky, if you like."</p>

<p>John wondered how Scaife had divined that he wished
to be cheeky. His mentor had said so much to Fluff and
him about the propriety of not putting on "lift" or "side"
in the presence of an older boy, that he had choked back a
retort which occurred to him.</p>

<p>"You're thinking," continued the Demon, in his clear
voice, "that I didn't use my brains just now, but, my
blooming innocent, I can assure you I did. Very much so. I
played 'possum. Put that into your little pipe and smoke it."</p>

<p>At four-o'clock Bill, John noticed C&aelig;sar's absence: a
fact accounted for by the presence of a mail-phaeton,
which, he knew, belonged to Mr. Desmond, drawn up&mdash;oddly
enough&mdash;opposite the Manor. What a joke to think
that C&aelig;sar was drinking tea with Dirty Dick!</p>

<p>After Bill, having nothing better to do, John and Fluff
went for a walk on the Sudbury road. They had played
football before Bill, and each had realized his own awkwardness
and insignificance. Poor Fluff, almost reduced to
tears, with a big black bruise upon his white forehead,
confessed that he preferred peaceful games&mdash;like croquet,
and intended to apply for a doctor's certificate of exemption.
Demanding sympathy, he received a slating.</p>

<p>"I play nearly as rotten a game as you do, Fluff,"
John said; "but Scaife expects us to be Torpids,<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> so we<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
jolly well have to buck up. That bruise over your eye
has taken off your painted-doll look. Now, if you're going
to blub, you'd better get behind that hedge."</p>

<p>Fluff exploded.</p>

<p>"This is a beastly hole," he cried. "And I loathe it.
I'm going to write to my father and beg him to take me
away."</p>

<p>"You ought to be at a girls' school."</p>

<p>"I hate everything and everybody. I thought you were
my friend, the only friend I had."</p>

<p>John was somewhat mollified.</p>

<p>"I am your friend, but not when you talk rot."</p>

<p>"Verney, look here, if you'll be decent to me, I <i>will</i> try
to stick it out. I wish I was like you; I do indeed. I
wish I was like Scaife. Why, I'd sooner be the Duffer,
freckles and all, than myself."</p>

<p>John looked down upon the delicately-tinted face, the
small, regular, girlish features, the red, quivering mouth.
Suddenly he grasped that this was an appeal from weakness
to strength, and that he, no older and but a little bigger
than Fluff, had strength to spare, strength to shoulder
burdens other than his own.</p>

<p>"All right," he said stiffly; "don't make such a fuss!"</p>

<p>"You'll have me for a friend, Verney?"</p>

<p>"Yes; but I ain't going to kiss your forehead to make
it well, you know."</p>

<p>"May I call you John, when we're alone? And I wish
you'd call me Esm&eacute;, instead of that horrid 'Fluff.'"</p>

<p>John pondered deeply.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said. "You can call me John, and
I'll call you Esm&eacute;, when we're Torpids. And now, you'd
better cut back to the house. I must think this all out,
and I can't think straight when I look at you."</p>

<p>"May I call you John once?"</p>

<p>"You are the silliest idiot I ever met, bar none. Call
me 'John,' or 'Tom Fool,' or anything; but hook it
afterwards!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, John, I will. You're the only boy I ever met
whom I really wanted for a friend." He displayed a radiant
face, turned suddenly, and ran off. John watched him,
frowning, because Fluff was a good little chap, and yet, at
times, such a bore!</p>

<p>He walked on alone, chewing the cud of a delightful
experience; trying, not unsuccessfully, to recall some of
Mr. Desmond's anecdotes. How proud C&aelig;sar was of his
father! And the father, obviously, was just as proud of
his son. What a pair! And if only C&aelig;sar were his friend!
By Jove! It was rather a rum go, but John was as mad
keen to call C&aelig;sar friend as poor Fluff to call John friend.
Serious food for thought, this. "But I would never
bother him," said John to himself, "as Fluff has bothered
me, never!"</p>

<p>"Hullo, Verney!"</p>

<p>"Hullo!" said John.</p>

<p>Coincidence had thrust C&aelig;sar out of his thought and
on to the narrow path in front of him.</p>

<p>"I'm not a ghost," said C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>John hesitated.</p>

<p>"I was thinking of you," he confessed; "and then I
heard your voice and saw you. It gave me a start. I say,
it <i>was</i> good of your governor to ask me."</p>

<p>"Hang my governor! He's the&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar closed his lips firmly, as if he feared that terrible
adjectives might burst from them. John missed the sparkling
smile, the gay glance of the eyes.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he demanded.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar hesitated; looked at John, read, perhaps, the
sympathy, the honest interest, possibly the affection, in
the grey orbs which met his own so steadily.</p>

<p>"What's up?" he repeated. "Why, I'm not going
into Damer's, after all."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said John.</p>

<p>"My governor has just told me. I came down here to
curse and swear."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span></p>

<p>"Not going into Damer's? What rot&mdash;for you!"</p>

<p>"It is sickening. Look here, Verney; I feel like telling
you about it. I know you won't go bleating all over the
shop. No. I said to myself, 'Mum's the word,' but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>John's heart beat, his body glowed, his grey eyes
sparkled.</p>

<p>"It's like this," continued C&aelig;sar, after a slight pause.
"Damer told the governor that two fellows he had expected
to leave at the end of this term were staying on. The
governor hinted that Damer added something about straining
a point, and letting me in ahead of three other fellows;
but the governor wouldn't listen to that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jolly decent of him," said John.</p>

<p>"Was it? In my opinion he ought to have thought of
me first. All my brothers have been at Damer's. And he
knew I'd set my heart on going there. Look how civil the
fellows are to me. I've been in and out of the house like
a tame cat. Confound it! if Damer did want to strain a
point, why shouldn't he? The governor played his own
game, not mine. What right has he to be so precious unselfish
at my expense? I argued with him; but he can
put his foot down. Let's cut all that. Of course, I don't
want to stop in a beastly Small House for ever, and, if
Damer's is closed to me, I should like Brown's, but Brown's
is full too. And there are other good houses. But where&mdash;where
do you think I <i>am</i> going?"</p>

<p>"Reeds?"</p>

<p>"I don't call Reed's so bad. No; I'm going to Dirty
Dick's. I'm coming to you."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say."</p>

<p>"Why, dash it all, you're grinning. I don't want to be
a cad&mdash;Dirty Dick's is <i>your</i> house&mdash;but&mdash;after Damer's!
O Lord!"</p>

<p>The grin faded out of John's face. C&aelig;sar's loss outweighed
his own gain.</p>

<p>"Your governor was a Manorite," he said slowly.</p>

<p>"Yes, in its best days; and he's always had a sneaking<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
liking for it; but he knows, he knows, I say, that now it's
rotten, and yet he sends me there. Why?"</p>

<p>"Ask another," said John.</p>

<p>"I asked him another, and what do you think he said,
in that peculiar voice of his which always dries me up?
'Harry,' said he, 'when you're a little older and a good deal
wiser, you'll be able to answer that question yourself.'"</p>

<p>John's face brightened. A glimmering of the truth
shone out of the darkness. He tried to advance nearer to
it, gropingly.</p>

<p>"I dare say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well, go on!"</p>

<p>"Your governor may feel that we want a fellow like
you."</p>

<p>John was blushing because he remembered what the
Head of the House had said about the Verneys. Desmond
glanced at him keenly. He detested flattery laid on too
thick. But this was a genuine tribute. For the first time
he smiled.</p>

<p>"Thank you, Verney," he said, more genially. "What
you say is utter rot; but it was decent of you to say it, and
I'm glad that you and I are going to be in the same house."</p>

<p>For his life John could not help adding, "And Scaife,
you forget Scaife?" Jealousy pierced him as Scaife's name
slipped out.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's the Demon. I always liked him."</p>

<p>"And he likes you."</p>

<p>"Does he? Good old Demon! I like to be liked.
That's the Irish in me. I'm half Irish, you know. I want
fellows to be friendly to me. I'd forgotten Scaife. That's
rum too, because he's not the sort one forgets, is he? No,
I wonder if I could get into the Demon's room next term?"</p>

<p>"I'm in his room. It's a three-room."</p>

<p>"A two-room is much jollier."</p>

<p>"Our room is not bad."</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar was hardly listening. John caught a murmur:
"The old Demon and I would get along capitally."</p>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">Some five</span> years afterwards John Verney learned what had
passed between Cabinet Minister and Head Master upon
that eventful day which sent C&aelig;sar to curse and swear upon
the Sudbury road. The Head Master was not an Harrovian,
and on that account was the better able to perceive
time-honoured abuses. At Harrow the dominant chord
among masters and boys is a harmony of strenuousness and
sentiment. Inevitably, the sentiment becomes, at times,
sentimental; and then strenuousness pushes it into a corner.
When honoured veterans are wearing out, loyalty, gratitude
for past service, reluctance to inflict pain, keep them in
positions of responsibility which mentally and physically
they are unfit to administer. It is almost as difficult to
turn an Eton or Harrow master out of his house, as to turn
a parson of the Church of England out of his pulpit. More,
in selecting a house-master as in selecting a parson, a man's
claims to preferment are too often determined by scholarship,
by length of former service, by interest with authority,
rather than by ability to govern a body of boys made up of
widely different parts. A capable form-master may prove
an incapable house-master. Richard Rutford, to give a
concrete example, came to Harrow knowing nothing about
Public Schools, and caring as little for the traditions of the
Hill, but with the prestige of being a Senior Classic. Nobody<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
questioned his ability to teach Greek. In his own line, and
not an inch beyond, the Governors were assured that
Rutford was a success. In due time he accepted a Small
House, so small that its autocrat's incapacity as an administrator
escaped notice. Rutford waited patiently for a big
morsel. He wrote a couple of text-books; he married a
wife with money and influence; he entertained handsomely.
It is true he became popular neither with masters nor boys,
but his wine was as sound as his scholarship, and his wife
had a peer for a second cousin. Eventually he accepted the
Manor. Within a month, those in authority suspected that
a blunder had been made; within a year they knew it.
The house began to go down. Leaven lay in the lump, but
not enough to make it rise, because the baker refused to
stir the dough. First and last, Rutford disliked boys,
misunderstood them, insulted them, ignored those who
lacked influential connections, toadied and pampered the
"swells."</p>

<p>Just before John Verney came to Harrow, the Manor
was showing unmistakable signs of decay. A new Head
Master, recognizing "dry-rot," realizing the necessity of
cutting it out, was confronted with that bristling obstacle&mdash;Tradition.
He possessed enough moral courage to have
told Rutford to resign, because in a thousand indescribable
ways the man had neglected his duty; but, so said the
Tories, such a step might provoke a public scandal, and if
Rutford refused to go&mdash;what then? Nothing definite
could be proved against the man. His sins had been of
omission. Dismayed, not defeated, the Head Master considered
other methods of regenerating the Manor. Very
quietly he made his appeal to the Old Harrovians, many of
whom were sending their sons and nephews to other houses.
He invited co-operation. John Verney, the Rev. Septimus
Duff, Colonel Egerton&mdash;half a dozen enthusiastic Manorites&mdash;stepped
forward. Lastly, for Charles Desmond the Head
Master baited his hook.</p>

<p>"The reform which we have at heart," said he, "must<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span>
come from within and from below. The house wants a
Desmond in it. I was not allowed to wield the axe; but,
after all, there are more modern methods of decapitation.
And, believe me, I am not asking any man more than I am
prepared to do myself. My own nephew goes to the Manor
after next holidays."</p>

<p>"Um!" said Mr. Desmond, stroking his chin.</p>

<p>"Lawrence, the Head of the House, is a tower of strength,
like all the Lawrences."</p>

<p>"How did you beguile the Duke of Trent?"</p>

<p>"Fortune gave me that weapon. The duke"&mdash;he
laughed genially&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"Will turn scales which my heaviest arguments won't
budge. A bit of luck! The duke wanted to send his son,
a delicate lad, to Harrow, and I did mention to him that
Rutford had a vacancy."</p>

<p>"O Ulysses! And Scaife? How did you handle that
large bale of bank-notes?"</p>

<p>"Rutford captured Scaife."</p>

<p>"Handsome boy&mdash;his son. Lunched with us this
morning. Well, well, you have persuaded me. But what
an unpleasant quarter of an hour I shall have with Harry!"</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As a new boy, John slaved at "footer," and displayed
a curious inaptitude for squash racquets. At all games
C&aelig;sar and Scaife were precociously proficient. John's
clumsiness annoyed them. Often the Caterpillar joined
him and Fluff, giving them to understand that this must be
regarded as an act of grace and condescension which might
be suitably acknowledged at the Tudor Creameries.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar mightily impressed the two small boys.
He had acquired his nick-name from the very leisurely pace
at which he advanced up the school. He wore "Charity
tails," as they were called, the swallow-tail coat of the
Upper School mercifully given to boys of the Lower School
who are too tall to wear with decency the short Eton jacket;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
he possessed a trouser-press; and his "bags" were perfectly
creased and quite spotless. From tip to toe, at all seasons
and in all weathers, he looked conspicuously spick and
span. Chaff provoked the solemn retort: "One should
be well groomed." He spoke impersonally, considering
it bad form to use for first person singular. Amongst the
small boys he ranked as the Petronius of the Lower School.</p>

<p>One day the Caterpillar said grandiloquently, "You
kids will oblige me by not shouting and yelling when you
speak to me. I've a bit of a head."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with it?" said Fluff.</p>

<p>"It looks splendid <i>outside</i>," said John, in his serious
voice.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar, detecting no cheek, answered gravely&mdash;</p>

<p>"Some of us had a wet night of it, last night."</p>

<p>"Wet?" exclaimed the innocent Fluff. "Why, all
the stars were shining."</p>

<p>"Your brothers at Eton know what a 'wet night'
means," said the Caterpillar. "I was talking with one of
the Fifth, when a fellow came in with a flask. A gentleman
ought to be able to carry a few glasses of wine, but one is
not accustomed to spirits."</p>

<p>"Spirits?"</p>

<p>"Whisky, not prussic acid, you know."</p>

<p>"But where do they get the whisky?" demanded John.</p>

<p>"Comparing it with my father's old Scotch, I should
say at the grocer's," replied the Caterpillar. "There's
some drinking going on in our house, and&mdash;and other
things. One mentions it to you kids as a warning."</p>

<p>"Thanks," said John.</p>

<p>"Not at all; you're rather decent little beggars. They"
(the Fifth Form was indicated), "they've let you alone
so far, but you may have trouble next term, so look out!
And if you want advice, come to me."</p>

<p>Beneath his absurd pompous manner beat a kindly
heart, and the small boys divined this and were grateful.
None the less the word "spirits" frightened them. Next<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[39]</a></span>
day John happened to find himself alone with C&aelig;sar. Very
nervously he asked the question&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, do any of the big fellows at Damer's drink?"</p>

<p>"Drink? Drink&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Well, spirits."</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar snorted an indignant denial. The fellows at
Damer's were above that sort of thing. The house prided
itself upon its tone. Tone constituted Damer's glory, and
was the secret of its success. John nodded, but two days
afterwards the Demon took him by the arm, twisted it
sharply, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"What the deuce did you mean by telling C&aelig;sar that
the Manorites drink?"</p>

<p>"Oh, Scaife&mdash;I didn't."</p>

<p>"You gave us away."</p>

<p>"<i>Us?</i>" John's eyes opened. "<i>You</i> don't drink with
'em?" he faltered.</p>

<p>"Don't bother your head about what I do, or don't do."
Scaife answered roughly; "and because you took the
Lower Remove don't think for an instant that you are on
a par with C&aelig;sar and me, or even the old Caterpillar&mdash;for
you ain't."</p>

<p>"I know that," said John, humbly.</p>

<p>"Don't forget it, or there may be ructions."</p>

<p>"I shan't forget it."</p>

<p>"That's right. And, by the way, you're getting into
the habit of hanging about C&aelig;sar, which bores him to
death. Stop it."</p>

<p>But to this John made no reply. He read dislike in
Scaife's bold eyes, detected it in his clear, peremptory voice,
felt it in the cruel twist of the arm. And he had brains
enough to know that Scaife was not the boy to dislike any
one without reason. John crawled to the conclusion that
Scaife had become jealous of his increasing intimacy with
Desmond.</p>

<p>However, when the three boys were preparing their
Greek for First School, Scaife seemed his old self, friendly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
amusing, and cool as a cucumber. Long ago he had
initiated John into Manorite methods of work.</p>

<p>"Our object is," he explained to the new boy, "to get
through the 'swat' with as little squandering of valuable
time as possible. It doesn't pay to be skewed. We must
mug up our 'cons' well enough to scrape along without
'puns' and extra school."</p>

<p>The three co-operated. Out of forty lines of Vergil,
Scaife would be fifteen, John fifteen, and the Caterpillar
ten; <i>ten</i>, because, as he pointed out, he had been nearly
three years in the school. Then each fellow in turn construed
his lines for the benefit of the others. A difficult
passage was taken by Scaife to a clever friend in the Fifth.
Sometimes Scaife would be absent twenty minutes, returning
flushed of face, and slightly excited. John wondered
if he had been drinking, and wondered also what C&aelig;sar
would say if he knew. About this time fear possessed his
soul that C&aelig;sar would come into the Manor and be taught
by Scaife to drink. An occasional nightmare took the form
of a desperate struggle between himself and Scaife, in which
Scaife, by virtue of superior strength and skill, had the
mastery, dragging off the beloved C&aelig;sar, to plunge with
him into fathomless pools of Scotch whisky. Somehow
in these horrid dreams, C&aelig;sar played an impressive part.
Scaife and John fought for his body, while he looked on,
an absurd state of affairs, never&mdash;as John reflected in his
waking hours&mdash;likely to happen in real life. Of all boys
C&aelig;sar seemed to be the best equipped to fight his own
battles, and to take, as he would have put it, "jolly good
care of himself."</p>

<p>After the first of the football house-matches, Scaife got
his "fez" from Lawrence, the captain of the House Eleven,
and the only member of the School Eleven in Dirty Dick's.
Some of the big fellows in the Fifth seized this opportunity
to "celebrate," as they called it. Scaife was popular with
the Fifth because&mdash;as John discovered later&mdash;he cheerfully
lent money to some of them and never pressed for repayment.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span>
And Scaife's getting his "fez" before he was fifteen
might be reckoned an achievement. C&aelig;sar, in particular,
could talk of nothing else. He predicted that the Demon
would be Captain of both Elevens, school racquet-player,
and bloom into a second C. B. Fry.</p>

<p>John, upon this eventful evening, soon became aware
of a shindy. It happened that Rutford was giving a
dinner-party, and extremely unlikely to leave the private
side of the house. John heard snatches of song, howls, and
cheers. Ordinarily Lawrence (in whose passage the shindy
was taking place) would have stopped this hullabaloo; but
Lawrence was dining with his house-master, and Trieve,
an undersized, weakly stripling, lacked the moral courage
to interfere. John was getting a "con" from Trieve when
an unusually piercing howl penetrated the august seclusion.</p>

<p>"What <i>are</i> they doing?" asked Trieve, irritably.</p>

<p>John hesitated. "It's the Fifth," he blurted out.
"They've got Scaife in there, you know."</p>

<p>"Oh, indeed! Scaife is an excuse, is he, for this
fiendish row? Go and tell Scaife I want to see him."</p>

<p>John looked rather frightened. He felt like a spaniel
about to retrieve a lion. And scurrying along the passage
he ran headlong into the Duffer, to whom he explained his
errand.</p>

<p>"Phew-w-w!" said that young gentleman. "I'd sooner
it was you than me, Verney. They're pretty well ginned-up,
I can tell you."</p>

<p>John tapped timidly at the door of the room whence
the songs and laughter proceeded. Then he tapped again,
and again. Finally, summoning his courage, he rapped
hard. Instantly there was silence, and then a furtive
rustling of papers, followed by a constrained "Come in!"</p>

<p>John entered.</p>

<p>Most of the boys&mdash;there were about six of them&mdash;gazed
at him in stupefaction. Scaife, very red in the face, burst
into shrill shouts of laughter. Somehow the laughter disconcerted
John. He forgot to deliver his message, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
stood staring at Scaife, quaking with a young boy's terror
of the unknown. Upon the table were some siphons,
syrups, and the remains of a "spread."</p>

<p>"What the blazes do you want?" said Lovell, the
owner of the room.</p>

<p>"I want Scaife," said John. "I mean that Trieve
wants Scaife."</p>

<p>"Oh, Miss Trieve wants Master Scaife, does she?
Well, young 'un, you tell Trieve, with my compliments,
that Scaife can't come. See? Now&mdash;hook it!"</p>

<p>But John still stared at Scaife. The boy's dishevelled
appearance, his wild eyes, his shrill laughter, revealed
another Scaife.</p>

<p>"You'd better come, Scaife," he faltered.</p>

<p>"Not I," said Scaife. He spoke in a curiously high-pitched
voice, quite unlike his usual cool, quiet tone.
"Wait a mo'&mdash;I'm not Trieve's fag. I'm nobody's fag
now, am I?"</p>

<p>He appealed to the crowd. It was an unwritten rule
at the Manor that members of the House cricket or football
Elevens were exempt from fagging. But the common
law of fagging at Harrow holds that any lower boy is
bound to obey the Monitors, provided such obedience is
not contrary to the rules of the school. In practice,
however, no boy is fagged outside his own house, except
for cricket-fagging in the summer term.</p>

<p>"Fag? Not you? Tell Miss Trieve to mind her own
business."</p>

<p>John departed, feeling that an older and wiser boy might
have tact to cope with this situation. For him, no course
of action presented itself except delivering what amounted
to a declaration of war.</p>

<p>"Won't come? Is he mad?"</p>

<p>"'Can't come,' they said."</p>

<p>"Oh, can't come? Has he hurt himself&mdash;sprained
anything?"</p>

<p>John was truthful (more of a habit than some people<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
believe). He told the truth, just as some boys quibble and
prevaricate, simply and naturally. But now, he hesitated.
If he hinted&mdash;a hint would suffice&mdash;that Scaife had hurt
himself&mdash;and what more likely after the furious bit of
playing which had secured his "fez"?&mdash;Trieve, probably,
would do nothing. John felt in his bones that Trieve
would be glad of an excuse to do&mdash;nothing.</p>

<p>"No; he hasn't sprained himself."</p>

<p>"Then why don't he come?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" Then he burst into excited speech. "He
looks as if he <i>was</i> a little mad. Oh, Trieve, won't you leave
him alone? Please do! They must stop before prayers,
and then Lawrence will be here."</p>

<p>O unhappy John&mdash;thou art not a diplomatist! Why
lug in Lawrence, who has inspired mordant jealousy and
envy in the heart of his second in command?</p>

<p>"Tell Scaife to come here at once," said Trieve, eyeing
a couple of canes in the corner. "And if he should happen
to ask what I want him for, say that I mean to whop him."</p>

<p>John fled.</p>

<p>"Whop him?"</p>

<p>The Fifth howled rage and remonstrance. Scaife
fiercely announced his intention of not taking a whopping
from Trieve. None the less, the announcement had a
sobering effect upon the elder boys. The consequence of a
refusal must prove serious. Sooner or later Scaife would be
whopped, probably by Lawrence, no ha'penny matter
that!</p>

<p>"You'd better go, Demon," said Lovell. "Trieve
can't hurt you. I'd speak to the idiot, only he hates me so
poisonously, just as I hate him."</p>

<p>"I'll go," said the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>John had not noticed the Caterpillar before. He stood
up, spick and span, carefully adjusting his coat, pulling
down his immaculate cuffs.</p>

<p>"Good old Caterpillar," said somebody. "By Jove,
he really thinks that Trieve will listen to&mdash;him!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span></p>

<p>"Any one who has been nearly three years in this
house," said the Caterpillar, "has the right to tell Miss
Trieve that she is&mdash;er&mdash;not behaving like a lady."</p>

<p>"And he'll tell you you're screwed, you old fool."</p>

<p>"I am not screwed," replied the Caterpillar, solemnly.
"Whisky and potass does not agree with everybody; but
I am not screwed, not at all." So speaking he sat down
rather suddenly.</p>

<p>Lovell shrugged his shoulders, glanced at the Caterpillar
and Scaife, and left the room. Within two minutes he
returned, chapfallen and frowning.</p>

<p>"I knew it would be useless. Look here, Demon, you
must grin and bear it."</p>

<p>"No," said Scaife, "not from Miss Trieve."</p>

<p>He laughed as before. The Fifth exchanged glances.
Then Scaife said thickly, "Give me another drink, I want
a drink; so does young Verney. Look at him!"</p>

<p>John was white about the gills and trembling, but not
for himself.</p>

<p>"Do go, Scaife!" he entreated.</p>

<p>The Fifth formed a group; holding a council of war,
engrossed in trying to find a way out of a wood which
of a sudden had turned into a tangled thicket. And so
what each would have strenuously prevented came to pass.
Scaife pulled a bottle from under a sofa-cushion, and put
it to his lips&mdash;John, standing at the door, could not see
what was taking place.</p>

<p>When the bottle was torn from Scaife's hands, the
mischief had been done. The boy had swallowed a quantity
of raw spirit. Till now the whisky had been much
diluted with mineral water.</p>

<p>"I'm going to him," yelled Scaife, struggling with his
friends. "And I'm going to take a cricket stump with me.
Le'me go&mdash;le'me go!"</p>

<p>The Caterpillar surveyed him with disgust. After a
brief struggle Scaife succumbed, helpless and senseless.</p>

<p>"One is reminded sometimes," said the Caterpillar,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
solemnly, "that the poor Demon is the son of a Liverpool
merchant, bred in or about the Docks."</p>

<p>Nobody, however, paid any attention to Egerton, who,
to do him justice, was the only boy present absolutely unmindful
of his own peril. Expulsion loomed imminent.
The window was flung wide open, eau de Cologne liberally
applied. Scaife lay like a log.</p>

<p>And then, in the middle of the confusion, Trieve walked
in.</p>

<p>"Scaife has had a sort of fit," explained an accomplished
liar. "You know what his temper is, Trieve? And when
he heard that you meant to 'whop' him, he went stark,
staring mad."</p>

<p>This explanation was so near the truth that Trieve
accepted it, probably with mental reservations.</p>

<p>"You had better send for Mrs. Puttick," he replied
coldly.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar was despatched for the matron; but
before that worthy woman panted upstairs, Scaife had
been carried to his own room, hastily undressed and put
into bed, where he lay breathing stertorously. The matron,
good, easy soul, accepted the boys' story unhesitatingly.
A fit, of course, poor dear child! Mr. Rutford must be
summoned.</p>

<p>With the optimism of youth, those present began to
hope that dust might be thrown into the eyes of Dirty Dick.
And, with a little discreet delay, the Demon might recover,
when he could be relied upon to play his part with adroitness
and ability. Accordingly, the matron was urged to
try her ministering hand first, amid the chaff, which, even
in emergencies, slips so easily out of boys' mouths.</p>

<p>"Mrs. Puttick, you're better than any doctor&mdash;Scaife
is all right, <i>really</i>. We knew that he was subject to fits&mdash;Rather!
Some one was telling me that one of his aunts
died in a fit"&mdash;"Shut up, you silly fool," this in a whisper,
emphasized by a kick; "do you want to send her out of
this with a hornets' nest tied to her back hair?&mdash;That's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
a lie, Mrs. Puttick. He's humbugging you. Scaife told
me that his fits were nothing. Yes; he had a slight sun-stroke
when he was a kid, you know, and the least bit of
excitement affects him."</p>

<p>"Perhaps I'd better fetch a drop of brandy," said Mrs.
Puttick, staring anxiously at Scaife. "He looks very bad."</p>

<p>"Yes, please do, Mrs. Puttick."</p>

<p>She bustled away.</p>

<p>"Now we <i>must</i> bring him to," said the Fifth Form.</p>

<p>Everything was tried, even to the expedient of flicking
Scaife's body with a wet towel; but the body lay motionless,
his face horribly red against the white pillow, his heavy
breathing growing more laboured and louder. And despite
the perfume of the eau de Cologne which had drenched
pillow and pyjamas, the smell of whisky spread terror to
the crowd. If Rutford came in, he would swoop on the
truth.</p>

<p>"We'll souse the brandy all over him," said the Caterpillar;
"and then no one can guess."</p>

<p>"How about burnt feathers?" suggested Lovell. He
had seen a fainting housemaid treated with this family
restorative.</p>

<p>Mrs. Puttick appeared with the brandy, which Lovell
administered externally. Still, Scaife remained unconscious.
Then a pillow was ripped open, and enough
feathers burned to restore&mdash;as the Caterpillar put it afterwards&mdash;a
ruined cathedral. The stench filled the passage
and brought to No. 15 a chattering crowd of Lower Boys.
And then the conviction seized everybody that Scaife was
going to die.</p>

<p>"Make way, make way, please!"</p>

<p>It was Rutford, who, followed by Lawrence, strode
down the passage into No. 15, and up to the bed.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said Lovell, "Scaife has had a fit."</p>

<p>"It looks like a fit," said Rutford, gravely. "I have
telephoned for the doctor. You've tried," he sniffed the
air, "all the wrong remedies, of course. Feathers&mdash;phaugh!&mdash;perfume&mdash;brandy!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
The boy must be propped
up and the blood drawn from his head by applying hot
water to his feet."</p>

<p>The Fifth exchanged glances. Why had this not
occurred to them? What a fool Mrs. Puttick was!</p>

<p>"A rush of blood to the head!" Rutford liked to hold
forth, and he had been told that he was a capital after-dinner
speaker. He had just risen from an excellent
dinner; he was not much alarmed; and his audience
listened with flattering attention. Scaife was lifted into
a chair; ice was applied to his head; his feet were thrust
into a "tosh" filled with steaming water.</p>

<p>"Note the effect," said Rutford. Already a slight
change might be perceived; the breathing became easier,
the face less red. Rutford continued in his best manner:
"Mark the <i>vis medicatrix natur&aelig;</i>. Nature, assisted by hot
water, gently accomplishes her task. Very simple, and
not one of you had the wit to think of a remedy close at
hand, and so easy to administer. The breathing is becoming
normal. In a few minutes I predict that we shall
have the satisfaction of seeing the poor dear fellow open
his eyes, and he will tell us that he is but little the worse.
Yes, yes, a rush of blood to the head producing cerebral disturbance."</p>

<p>He smiled blandly, receiving the homage of the Fifth.</p>

<p>"And now, Lovell, what do you know about this?
Did this fit take place here?"</p>

<p>"In my room, sir."</p>

<p>"In your room&mdash;eh? What was Scaife, a Lower Boy,
doing in your room?"</p>

<p>"Lawrence gave him his 'fez' to-day, sir."</p>

<p>Lawrence nodded.</p>

<p>"Ah! And Scaife was excited, perhaps unduly excited&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>The Fifth joined in a chorus of, "Yes, sir&mdash;Oh, yes,
sir&mdash;awfully excited, sir&mdash;never saw a boy so excited,
sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>"That will do. Now, Lovell, go on!"</p>

<p>"We had some siphons in our room, sir." A stroke
of genius this&mdash;for the siphons were still on the table and
the syrups, and the <i>d&eacute;bris</i> of cakes and meringues. Rutford
would be sure to examine the scene of the catastrophe; and
the whisky bottle was carefully hidden. "We were having
a spread, sir, and we asked Scaife to join us. His play
to-day made him one of us."</p>

<p>The other boys gazed admiringly at Lovell. What a
cool, knowing hand!</p>

<p>"Yes, yes, I see nothing objectionable about that."</p>

<p>"Well, sir&mdash;we were rather noisy&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on."</p>

<p>"To speak the exact truth, sir, I fear we were <i>very</i>
noisy; and Trieve, it seems, heard us. Instead of sending
for me, sir, he sent Verney for Scaife&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah!"</p>

<p>Lovell's hesitation at this point was really worthy of
Coquelin <i>cadet</i>.</p>

<p>"Of course you know, sir, that Scaife's getting his 'fez'
releases him from house-fagging. We thought Trieve had
forgotten that, sir; and that it would be rather fun&mdash;I'm
not excusing myself, sir&mdash;we thought it would be a harmless
joke if we persuaded Scaife not to go."</p>

<p>"Um!"</p>

<p>"We were very foolish, sir. And then Trieve sent
another message saying that Scaife was to go to his room
at once to be&mdash;whopped."</p>

<p>"To be whopped. Um! Rather drastic that, very
drastic under the circumstances."</p>

<p>"So we thought, sir; and I went to represent the facts
to Trieve&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"I'm not much of a peacemaker, I fear, sir. Trieve
refused to listen to me. He insisted upon whopping Scaife
for what he called disobedience and impudence. Upon
my honour, sir, I tried, we all tried, to persuade Scaife to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
take his whopping quietly, but he seemed to go quite mad.
He has a violent temper, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes, yes."</p>

<p>"A very violent temper. He&mdash;he&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Frothed at the mouth," put in a bystander. "I
particularly noticed that."</p>

<p>"Really, really&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lovell, nodding his head reflectively. "He
frothed at the mouth, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Grew quite black in the face," interpolated a third
boy, who was determined that Lovell should not carry
off all the honours.</p>

<p>"I should say&mdash;purple," amended Lovell. "And then
he gave&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A beastly gurgle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"A sort of snort, and fell flat on his face. I'm not sure
that he didn't strike the edge of the table as he fell."</p>

<p>"He did," said one of the boys. "I saw that."</p>

<p>At this moment Scaife moved in his chair, drawing all
eyes to his face. John, peering from behind the circle of
big boys, could see the first signs of returning consciousness,
a flicker of the eyelids, a convulsive tremor of the limbs.
Rutford bent down.</p>

<p>"Well, my dear Scaife, how are you? We've been a
little anxious, all of us, but, I ventured to predict, without
cause. Tell us, my poor boy, how do you feel?"</p>

<p>Scaife opened his eyes. Then he groaned dismally.
Rutford was standing to the right of the chair and foot-bath.
The Fifth were facing Scaife. He met their
anxious, admonishing glances, unable to interpret
them.</p>

<p>Lovell senior repeated the house-master's question&mdash;</p>

<p>"How are you, old chap?"</p>

<p>But, in his anxiety to convey a warning, he came too
near, obscuring Rutford's massive figure. Scaife groaned
again, putting his hand to his head.</p>

<p>"How am I?" he repeated thickly. "Why, why, I'm<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
jolly well screwed, Lovell; that's how I am! Jolly well
screwed&mdash;hay? Ugh! how screwed I am. Ugh!"</p>

<p>The groans fell on a terrifying silence. Rutford glanced
keenly from face to face. Then he said slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>"The wretched boy is&mdash;<i>drunk</i>!"</p>

<p>At the sound of his house-master's voice, Scaife relapsed
into an insensibility which no one at the moment cared to
pronounce counterfeit or genuine. Rutford glared at
Lovell.</p>

<p>"Who was in your room, Lovell?"</p>

<p>Without waiting for Lovell to answer, the other boys,
each in turn, said, "I, sir," or "Me, sir." John came last.</p>

<p>"Anybody else, Lovell?"</p>

<p>A discreet master would not have asked this question,
but Dirty Dick was the last man to waive an advantage.
Now, the Caterpillar had quietly left No. 15, as soon as
Rutford entered it. Not from any cowardly motive, but&mdash;as
he put it afterwards&mdash;"because one makes a point of
retiring whenever a rank outsider appears. One ought to
be particular about the company one keeps." It says
something for the boy's character, that this statement was
accepted by the house as unvarnished truth. Lovell
glanced at the other Fifth Form boys, as Rutford repeated
the question.</p>

<p>"Anybody else, Lovell? Be careful how you answer
me!"</p>

<p>"Nobody else," said Lovell.</p>

<p>"On your honour, sir?"</p>

<p>"On my honour, sir."</p>

<p>And, later, all Manorites declared that Lovell had lied
like a gentleman. Rutford and he stared at each other, the
boy pale, but self-possessed, the big, burly man flushed
and ill at ease.</p>

<p>"You will all go to my study. A word with you,
Lawrence."</p>

<p>The boys filed quietly out. Rutford looked at John and
Fluff. Large, fat tears were trickling down Fluff's cheeks.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
Somehow he felt convinced that John was involved in a
frightful row.</p>

<p>"Run away, Kinloch," said his house-master. "I wish
to speak with Lawrence and Verney."</p>

<p>He turned to Lawrence as he spoke. John glanced at
Scaife. His eyes were open. Silently, Scaife placed a
trembling finger upon his lips. The action, the expression
in the eyes, were unmistakable. John understood, as
plainly as if Scaife had spoken, that silence, where expulsion
impended, was not only expedient but imperative. Kinloch
crept out of the room. Rutford examined Scaife,
who feigned insensibility. Then he addressed Lawrence.</p>

<p>"Go to Lovell's room, Lawrence, and institute a
thorough search. If you find wine or spirits, let me know
at once."</p>

<p>Lawrence left the room.</p>

<p>"Now, Verney, I am going to ask you a few questions."
He assumed his rasping, truculent tone. "And don't you
dare to tell me lies, sir!"</p>

<p>John was about to repudiate warmly his house-master's
brutal injunction, when the habit of thinking before he
spoke closed his half-opened lips. Immediately, his face
assumed the obstinate, expressionless look which made
those who searched no deeper than the surface pronounce
him a dull boy. Rutford, for instance, interpreted this
stolidity as unintelligence and lack of perception. John,
meantime, was struggling with a thought which shaped
itself slowly into a plan of action. He had just heard
Lovell lie to save the Caterpillar. John knew well enough
that he might be called upon to lie also, to save not
himself, but Scaife. If he held his tongue and refused to
answer questions, Rutford would assume, and with reason,
that Scaife had been made drunk by the Fifth Form
fellows.</p>

<p>Then John said quietly, "I am not a liar, sir."</p>

<p>"Certainly, I have never detected you in a lie," said
Rutford.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span></p>

<p>"All the same," continued John, in a hesitating manner,
"I <i>would</i> lie, if I thought a lie might save a friend's life."</p>

<p>Rutford was so unprepared for this deliberate statement,
that he could only reply&mdash;</p>

<p>"Oh, you would, would you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John; then he added, "Any decent boy
or man would."</p>

<p>"Oh! Oh, indeed! This is very interesting. Go on,
Verney."</p>

<p>"Scaife said he <i>felt</i> as if he was jolly well screwed, sir;
but he isn't. I'm quite sure he isn't. He may feel like
it; but he isn't."</p>

<p>John could see Scaife's eyes, slightly blood-shot, but
sparkling with a sort of diabolical sobriety. At that
moment, one thing alone seemed certain, Scaife had regained
full possession of his faculties. Rutford stared at
John, frowning.</p>

<p>"You dare to look me in the face and tell me that
Scaife is not drunk?"</p>

<p>Very seriously, John answered, "I'm sure he's not
drunk, sir."</p>

<p>Rutford eyed the boy keenly.</p>

<p>"Have you ever seen anybody drunk?" he demanded.</p>

<p>"I live in the New Forest," said John, as gravely as
before, "and on Whit-Monday&mdash;&mdash;" He was aware that
he had made an impression upon this big, truculent man.</p>

<p>"Don't try to be funny with me, Verney."</p>

<p>"On no, sir, as if I should dare!"</p>

<p>"Well, well, we are wasting time. Trieve sent you to
Lovell's room to fetch Scaife?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"And what was Scaife doing when you went into the
room? Be very careful!"</p>

<p>John considered. "He was laughing, sir."</p>

<p>"Laughing, was he?"</p>

<p>"But he stopped laughing when I gave him Trieve's
message, and then he said what Lovell told you, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span></p>

<p>"Never mind what Lovell told me. Give me your
version of the story."</p>

<p>"Scaife asked the other fellows if Trieve had any right
to fag him, now that he had got his 'fez.' If he had
been drunk, sir, he wouldn't have thought of that, would
he?"</p>

<p>"Um," said Rutford, slightly shaken. John described
his return to Trieve's room, and Trieve's threat.</p>

<p>"Lovell and you tell the same story."</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir." John made no deliberate attempt to
look simple; but his face, to the master studying it, seemed
quite guileless.</p>

<p>Just then, Dumbleton ushered in the doctor. To him
Rutford recited what he knew and what he suspected. He
had hardly finished speaking, when Scaife opened his eyes
for the second time. By a curious coincidence, the doctor
used the words of the house-master.</p>

<p>"Well, sir, how do you feel?"</p>

<p>And then Scaife answered, in the same dazed fashion
as before&mdash;</p>

<p>"I feel as if I was jolly well screwed, sir."</p>

<p>Rutford nodded portentously.</p>

<p>"I feel," continued Scaife, "as I did once long ago,
when I was a kid and got hold of some cura&ccedil;oa at one of
my father's parties."</p>

<p>"Just so," said the doctor.</p>

<p>"Same buzzing in the head, same beastly feeling, same&mdash;same
old&mdash;same old&mdash;giddiness." He closed his eyes, and
his head fell heavily upon his chest.</p>

<p>"It looks like concussion," said the doctor, doubtfully.
"You say he fell?" He turned to John.</p>

<p>"I was just outside the door," said John.</p>

<p>"We'll put him into the sick-room, Mr. Rutford. And
in a day or two he'll be himself again."</p>

<p>"Are you sure that what I&mdash;er&mdash;feared&mdash;er&mdash;&mdash;?"</p>

<p>The doctor frowned. "The boy has had brandy, of
course."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span></p>

<p>"Mrs. Puttick and Lovell gave him plenty of that,"
John interpolated.</p>

<p>"I believe you can exonerate the boy entirely," said
the doctor.</p>

<p>John saw that Rutford seemed relieved.</p>

<p>"I have ordered Lovell's room to be searched. If no
wine or spirits are found, I shall be glad to believe that I
have made a very pardonable mistake."</p>

<p>While Scaife was being removed, Lawrence came in
with his report. Nothing alcoholic had been discovered in
Lovell's room. After prayers, which were late that night,
Dirty Dick made a short speech.</p>

<p>"I had reason to suspect," said he, "that a gross breach
of the rules of the school had been made to-night by
certain boys in this house. It appears I was mistaken.
No more will be said on the subject by me; and I think that
the less said by you, big and small, the better. Good
night."</p>

<p>He strode away into the private side.</p>

<p>Two days later, Scaife came back to No. 15. John
wondered why he stared at him so hard upon the first
occasion when they happened to be alone. Then Scaife
said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, young Verney, I shan't forget that, if it hadn't
been for you, I should have been sacked. And I shan't
forget either that you're not half such a fool as you look."</p>

<p>John exhibited surprise.</p>

<p>"The way you handled the beast," continued Scaife,
"was masterly. I heard every word, though my head was
bursting. I shall tell Lovell that you saved us. Oh,
Lord&mdash;didn't I give the show away?"</p>

<p>He never tried to read the perplexity upon the other's
face, but went away laughing. He came back with the
Caterpillar half an hour later, and the three boys sat
down as usual to prepare some Livy. John was sensible
that his companions treated him not only as an equal&mdash;a
new and agreeable experience&mdash;but as a friend. In the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
course of the first ten minutes Scaife said to the Caterpillar&mdash;</p>

<p>"He told Dick to his face that he would lie to save a
pal."</p>

<p>And the Caterpillar replied seriously, "Good kid, very
good kid. Lovell says he's going to give a tea in his
honour."</p>

<p>"No, he isn't. It's my turn."</p>

<p>Accordingly, upon the next half-holiday, Scaife gave a
tea at the Creameries. Of all the strange things that had
happened during the past fortnight, this to our simple
John seemed the strangest. He was not conscious of having
done or said anything to justify the esteem and consideration
in which Scaife, the Caterpillar, and Lovell seemed to
hold him.</p>

<p>"You've forgotten Desmond," he said to Scaife, when
the latter mentioned the names of his guests.</p>

<p>"C&aelig;sar isn't coming. By the way, Verney, you've
not been talking to C&aelig;sar about the row in our house?"</p>

<p>"No," said John. "Lawrence came round and said
that I must keep my mouth shut."</p>

<p>"And naturally you did what you were told to do?"</p>

<p>The half-mocking tone disappeared in a burst of laughter
as John answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, of course."</p>

<p>"And I suppose it never entered your head that Lawrence
would not have been so particular about shutting your
mouth without good reason."</p>

<p>"Perhaps," said John, after a pause, "Lawrence was
in a funk lest, lest&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on!"</p>

<p>"Lest the thing should be exaggerated."</p>

<p>"Exactly. Lots of fellows would go about saying that
I was dead drunk&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"They might."</p>

<p>"And that would be coming dangerously near the truth."</p>

<p>"Oh, Scaife! Then you really <i>were</i>&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span></p>

<p>Scaife laughed again. "Yes, I really was, my Moses
in the bulrushes! Don't look so miserable. I guessed all
along that you weren't <i>quite</i> in the know. Well, I'm every
bit as grateful. You stood up to Dick like a hero. And
my tea is in your honour."</p>

<p>"Oh, Scaife&mdash;you&mdash;you won't do it again?"</p>

<p>"Get screwed?" said Scaife, gravely. "I shall not.
It isn't good enough. We've chucked the stuff away."</p>

<p>"If they'd found it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;if! The old Caterpillar attended to that. He's
a downy bird, I can tell you. When Dick came into our
room, he slipped back to Lovell's room, carried off the
whisky, hid it, washed the glasses, and then dirtied them
with siphon and syrup. The Caterpillar and you showed
great head. We shall drink your healths to-morrow&mdash;in
tea and chocolate."</p>

<p>John wondered what Scaife had said to the Fifth. At
any rate, they asked John no questions, and treated him
with distinguished courtesy and favour; but that evening,
when John was fagging in Lawrence's room, the great
man said abruptly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I saw you walking with Lovell senior this afternoon."</p>

<p>John explained. Lawrence frowned.</p>

<p>"Oh, you've been celebrating, have you? Thanksgiving
service at the Creameries. Now, look here, Verney,
I've met your uncle, and he asked me to keep an eye on
you. Because of that I made you my fag&mdash;you, a green
hand, when I had the pick of the House."</p>

<p>"It was awfully good of you," said John, warmly.</p>

<p>"We'll sink that. I'm five years older than you, and
I know every blessed&mdash;and <i>cursed</i>"&mdash;he spoke with great
emphasis&mdash;"thing that goes on in this house. I know, for
instance, that dust was thrown, and very cleverly thrown,
into Rutford's eyes, and you helped to throw it. Don't
speak! You didn't quite know what you were up to.
Well, it's lucky for Lovell and Co. that one innocent kid
was mixed up in that affair. But it's been rather unlucky<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
for you. I'd sooner see you kicked about a bit by those
fellows than petted. I'm sorry&mdash;sorry, do you hear?&mdash;the
whole lot were not sacked. And now you can hook it.
I've said enough, perhaps too much, but I believe I can
trust you."</p>

<p>After this John showed his gratitude by painstaking
attention to fagging. Lawrence became aware of faithful
service: that his toast was always done to a turn, that his
daily paper was warmed, as John had seen the butler at
home warm the <i>Times</i>, that his pens were changed, his
blotting-paper renewed, and so forth. In John's eyes,
Lawrence occupied a position near the apex of the world's
pyramid of great men.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The remainder</span> of the term slipped away without farther
accident or incident. Apart from the preparation of work,
John saw little of Scaife or Egerton. The Fifth nodded to
him in a friendly fashion when he passed them in the
street, and, greater kindness on their part, left him alone.
Possibly, Lawrence had said a word to Lovell. Such leisure
as John enjoyed (a new boy at Harrow has not much) he
spent with the devoted Fluff. Desmond and Scaife walked
together on Sunday afternoons. But the fact that Desmond
seemed to be vanishing out of his horizon made no
difference to John's ever-increasing affection for him. Very
humbly, he worshipped at a distance. On clear, dry days
Fluff and he would climb to the top of the wall of the
squash racquet-courts to see Scaife and Desmond play a
single. They were extraordinarily well-matched in strength,
activity, and skill. John noticed, however, that the Demon
lost his temper when he lost a game, whereas C&aelig;sar only
laughed. Somehow John divined that the Demon was
making the effort of his life to secure Desmond's friendship.
And C&aelig;sar had ideals, standards to which the Demon
pretended to attain. Good, simple John made sure that
C&aelig;sar would elevate the Demon to his plane, that evil would
be exorcised by good. Only in his dreams did the Demon
have the advantage.</p>

<p>Just before the end of the term, C&aelig;sar said to him&mdash;</p>

<p>"After all, I'm jolly glad I'm coming into your House,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span>
because the old Demon is such a ripper; and he and I
have been talking things over. He's as mad keen as I am
about games, and although the Manorites have not played
in a cock-house match at cricket or footer for years, still
there is a chance for us at Torpids next term. You'll
play, Verney. You've improved a lot, so the Demon says,
and he'll be captain. Then there are the sports. If only
Dirty Dick could be knocked on the head, the Manor
might jump to the front again."</p>

<p>"It will," said John.</p>

<p>When the School reassembled after Christmas, Desmond
entered the Manor, and found himself with Scaife in a two-room.
A civil note from the man of millions had arranged
this. To John was given a two-room, also, with the Duffer
as stable companion. Fluff remained in No. 15. The
Duffer had got his remove from the Top Shell into John's
form. Scaife and Desmond were elevated into the Upper
Remove. It followed, therefore, that Scaife and Desmond
prepared work in their own room, the Caterpillar joining
the Duffer and John. Thus it will be seen that, although
Desmond had become a Manorite, he was, practically
speaking, out of John's orbit.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar had now been three years in the school,
and he governed himself accordingly. He put on a "barmaid"<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>
collar and spent much time on the top step of
the boys' entrance to the Manor. No mere two-year-old
presumed to occupy this sacred spot. Had he dared to
do so, the Caterpillar would have made things very sultry
for him. Also, he informed the Duffer and John that, by
virtue of his position, he proposed to prepare no work at
all. Each "con" was divided into two equal parts: the
Duffer "mugged" up one; John the other. Then the
Caterpillar would be summoned, and glean the harvest.
The Duffer had a crib or two, but the Caterpillar forbade
their use.</p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>
<p>"You kids," said he, "ought not to use 'Bohns.' Besides,
it's dangerous."</p>

<p>The Caterpillar's deportment and coolness filled John
and the Duffer with respect and admiration. The master
in charge of the Lower Remove happened to be short-sighted.
The Caterpillar took shameful advantage of this.
At repetitions, for instance, he would read Horace's odes
off a torn-out page concealed in the palm of his hand, or&mdash;if
practicable&mdash;pin the page on to the master's desk.</p>

<p>He had genius for extricating himself (and others) out
of what boys call tight places. One anecdote, well known
to the Lower School and repeated as proof of the Caterpillar's
masterly methods, may serve to illustrate the sort
of influence Egerton wielded. When he was in the Fourth,
his form met in the Old Schools in a room not far from that
august chamber used by the Head Master and Upper Sixth.
One day, the master in charge of the form happened to be
late. The small boys in the passage celebrated his absence
with dance and song. When the belated man arrived, a
monitor awaited him. The Head Master presented his
compliments to Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; and wished to learn the names
of the boys who had created such a scandalous disturbance.
Mr. A&mdash;&mdash; invited the roysterers to give up their names
under penalties of extra school. Hateful necessity! Silence
succeeded. A&mdash;&mdash; grew irate. The monitor tried to
conceal a smile.</p>

<p>"Any boy who was making any noise at all&mdash;stand up."</p>

<p>The Caterpillar rose slowly, long and thin, spick and span.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir," said he, "I was <i>whispering</i>!"</p>

<p>A&mdash;&mdash;'s sense of humour was tickled.</p>

<p>"My compliments to the Head Master," said he, "and
please tell him that I find, on careful inquiry, that Egerton
was&mdash;whispering."</p>

<p>A shout of laughter from Olympus proclaimed that the
message had been delivered. The Caterpillar had saved
the situation.</p>

<p>John became a disciple of this accomplished young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
gentleman and tried to imitate him. For Egerton represented,
faithfully enough, traditions to which John bowed
the knee. Upon any point of schoolboy honour his
authority ruled supreme. He told the truth among his
peers; he loathed obscenity; he disliked and condemned
bad language.</p>

<p>"The best men don't swear much," he would say. "It's
doosid bad form. I allow myself a 'damn' or two, nothing
more. My great-grandfather, who was one of the Regency
lot, was known as Cursing Egerton, but nowadays we leave
that sort of thing to bargees."</p>

<p>Quite unconsciously, John assimilated the Caterpillar's
axioms.</p>

<p>"We're not sent here at enormous expense to learn only
Latin and Greek. At Harrow and Eton one is licked into
shape for the big things: diplomacy, politics, the Services.
One is taught manners, what? I'm not a marrying sort
of man, but if I do have sons I shall send 'em here, even
if I have to pinch a bit."</p>

<p>This was the side of Egerton which appealed so strongly
to John. The Caterpillar was an Harrovian to the core,
like the Duffer and C&aelig;sar Desmond. He deplored the
increasing predominance of sons of very rich men. And he
anathematized Harrovian fathers who were persuaded by
Etonian wives to send their sons to the Plain instead of
to the Hill. That some of the famous Harrow families,
who owed so much to the School, should forsake it, seemed
to Egerton the unpardonable sin.</p>

<p>During this term, regretfully must it be recorded that
John scamped his "prep" and "ragged" in form whenever
a suitable chance presented itself. The Duffer and he
bribed a "Chaw"<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> to throw gravel against the windows
of the room where the boys were supposed to be mastering
the problems of Euclid and algebra. The "tique"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>
master had been Third Wrangler, but he couldn't tackle
his Division properly. Upon this occasion the "chaw"
created such a disturbance that (on audacious demand)
leave was granted to the Duffer and John to capture the
offender. The young rascals pursued the "chaw" as far
as the Metropolitan Station, and presented that conscientious
youth with another sixpence. Then it occurred
to John that it might be expedient to capture some bogus
prisoner; so by means of talk, sugared with chocolates,
they persuaded a little girl to impersonate the thrower of
gravel. The little girl, carefully coached in her part, was
led to the Wrangler, but stage-fright made her burst into
tears at the critical moment. Somehow or other the truth
leaked out; the Duffer and John were sent up to the Head
Master and "swished." Each collected a few twigs of the
birch, carefully preserved to this day.</p>

<p>Meantime, the Torpid house-matches were coming on,
and the School agreed, wonderingly, that Dirty Dick's had
a chance of being cock-house. The fact that the Manor
has lost caste brought about this possibility. Boys just
under fifteen found room at the Manor when other houses
were full. All the Manorites in the Shell and Removes
were fellows who had come to Harrow rather over than
under fourteen years of age.</p>

<p>And when the list of the Torpid Eleven was posted,
didn't John's heart boil with pride when he read his own
name at the bottom of it?</p>

<p>The Manor won the first and the second of the matches.
Then came the semi-final, with Damer's. When the teams
met in the playing-fields the difference in the size of the
players was remarked. Damer's Torpids were small boys,
not much bigger than John or the Duffer. But they had
behind them that stupendous force which is fashioned out
of pride, <i>esprit de corps</i>, self-confidence begotten of long-continued
success, and, strongest of all, the conviction that
every man-Jack would fight till he dropped for the honour
and glory of the crack house at Harrow. Not a boy in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
Damer's team was Scaife's equal as a player, but in Scaife's
strength lay the weakness of the Manorites. They relied
upon one player; Damer's pinned faith to eleven.</p>

<p>As it happened to be a fine day, the School turned out
in force to witness the match. Most of the masters were
present, and some ladies. Rutford, however, had business
elsewhere. The School commented upon his absence with
sly smiles and shrugs of the shoulder. Some of the
Manorites were indifferent; the better sort raged. The
Caterpillar appeared upon the ground in a faultless overcoat,
carrying a large bag of lemons. His straw hat was
cocked at a slight angle.</p>

<p>"One is really uncommonly obliged to Dirty Dick for
staying away," he told everybody. "Speaking personally,
the mere sight of him is very upsetting to me. Keen as
one feels about this match, one can't deny that there is not
room in a footer field for Dirty Dick and a self-respecting
person."</p>

<p>None the less, the absence of their house-master had a
bad effect upon the Torpids. Damer, you may be sure,
had come down, prepared to cheer louder than any boy
in his house; Damer, it was whispered, had been known
to shed tears when his house suffered defeat; Damer, in
fine, inspired ardours&mdash;a passion of endeavour.</p>

<p>Scaife won the toss and kicked off.</p>

<p>For the first five minutes nothing of interest happened.
Damer's played collectively; the Manorites rather waited
upon the individual. When Scaife's chance came, so it
was predicted, he would go through the Damer's centre
as irresistibly as a Russian battleship cuts through a fleet
of fishing-smacks.</p>

<p>Rutford being absent, Dumbleton, the butler, stood well
to the fore. He never missed a house-match, and no one
could guess, looking at his wooden countenance, how the
game was going; for he accepted either defeat or victory
with a dignified self-restraint. A smart bit of work provoked
a bland, "Well played, sir, <i>very well</i> played, sir!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span>
uttered in the same respectful tone in which he requested
Lovell, let us say, to go to Mr. Rutford's study after prayers.
The fags believed that "Dumber," who had begun his
career as boot-boy at the Manor in the glorious days of
old, had given notice to leave when he learned that Dirty
Dick was about to assume command; but had been prevailed
upon to stay by the promise of an enormous salary.
Nothing disturbed his equanimity. On the previous Saturday
evening, John had heated the wrong end of the poker
in No. 15, knowing that Dumber's duty constrained him to
march round the House after "lights out," to rake out any
fires that might be still burning. Snug under his counterpane,
the practical joker awaited, chuckling, a choleric
word from the impassive and impeccable butler. How
did Dumber divine that the poker was unduly hot and black
with soot underneath? Who can answer that question?
The fact remains that he seized John's best Sunday trousers
which were laid out on a chair, and holding the poker with
these, accomplished his task without remark or smile.
The trousers had to be sent to the tailor's to be cleaned.</p>

<p>Not far from Dumber stood a group of small boys,
including the unhappy Fluff&mdash;unhappy because he was not
playing, despite arduous training (entirely to please John)
and systematic coaching. His failure meant further separation
from John, whom, it will be remembered, he would
have been allowed to call by his Christian name, had he
been included amongst the Torpids. Of late, Fluff had not
seen much of John, and in his dark hours he allowed his
thoughts to linger, not unpleasantly sometimes, upon
premature death and John's subsequent remorse.</p>

<p>Meantime, Scaife and Desmond were playing a furious
game which must have proved successful had it not been
for the admirable steadiness of the enemy. Lawrence
watched their efforts with compressed lips and frowning
brows. He knew&mdash;who better?&mdash;that his cracks were
tearing themselves to tatters; but his protests were drowned
by the shrill cheers of the fags.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rutfords&mdash;Rutfor-r-r-r-r-ds! Go it, old Demon!&mdash;Jolly
well played, C&aelig;sar!&mdash;Sky him!<a name="FNanchor_17_17" id="FNanchor_17_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_17" class="fnanchor">[17]</a>&mdash;Well skied, sir!&mdash;Ah-h-h-h!
Well given&mdash;well taken!"</p>

<p>The last, long-drawn-out exclamation proclaimed that
"Yards"<a name="FNanchor_18_18" id="FNanchor_18_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_18" class="fnanchor">[18]</a> had been given to Scaife right in front of
Damer's base. Damer's retreated; Scaife, with heaving
chest, balanced the big ball between the tips of his fingers.</p>

<p>"Oh-h-h-h-h!"</p>

<p>Scaife had missed an easy shot. Lawrence could see
that the boy was trembling with disappointment and
mortification. Barbed arrows from Damer's small boys
pierced Manorite hearts.</p>

<p>"Jolly well boshed, Scaife!&mdash;Good, kind, old Demon!&mdash;Thank
you, Scaife!&mdash;" and like derisive approbation rolled
from lip to lip. The Caterpillar turned to Lovell.</p>

<p>"Showing temper, ain't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said Lovell.</p>

<p>"Clever chap," said the Caterpillar, reflectively; "but
one is reminded that a stream can't rise higher than its
source. Not mine that&mdash;the governor's! C&aelig;sar is facing
the chaff with a grin."</p>

<p>The game began again. But soon it became evident
that Scaife had lost, not only his temper, but his head.
He rushed here and there with so little judgment that the
odds amongst the sporting fellows went to six to four
against the Manor. At the beginning of the game they
were six to four the other way. And, inevitably, Scaife's
wild and furious efforts unbalanced Desmond's play.
Both boys were out of their proper places to the confusion
of the rest of the team. Within half an hour Damer's
had scored two bases to nothing.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar distributed halves of lemons. Lawrence
went up to Scaife. The captain of the Torpids was standing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
apart, not far from Desmond, who was sucking a lemon with
a puzzled expression. Gallant, sweet-tempered, and
always hopeful, C&aelig;sar could not understand his friend's
passion of rage and resentment. With the tact of his race,
however, he held aloof, smiling feebly, because he had sworn
to himself not to frown. Had he looked to his right, he
would have seen John, also sucking a lemon, but understudying
his idol's nonchalant attitude and smile. John
was sensible of an overpowering desire to fling himself
upon the ground and howl. Instead he sucked his lemon,
stared at Desmond, and smiled&mdash;valiantly.</p>

<p>"Scaife," said Lawrence, gravely, "you're not playing
the game."</p>

<p>Scaife scowled. "I only know I've half killed myself,"
he muttered.</p>

<p>Lawrence continued in the same steady voice, "Yes;
because you missed an easy base which has happened to
me and every other player scores of times. Come here,
Desmond."</p>

<p>Desmond joined them. Lawrence's face brightened
when he saw hopeful eyes and a gallant smile.</p>

<p>"You don't despair?"</p>

<p>"We'll knock 'em into smithereens yet."</p>

<p>"That's the Harrow spirit, but temper your determination
to win with a little common sense. You've overdone
it, both of you. Take my tip: they'll play up like blazes.
Defend your own base; and then, when they're spent,
trample on 'em."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said Desmond.</p>

<p>Scaife nodded sulkily.</p>

<p>None the less he had too great respect for Lawrence's
ability and experience as a captain to disregard his advice.
After the kick-off, Damer's <i>did</i> play up, and the Manor had
to defend its base against sustained and fierce attack.
Again and again a third base was almost kicked, again and
again superior weight prevailed in the scrimmages. Within
ten minutes Damer's were gasping and weary. And then,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span>
the ball was forced out of the scrimmage and kicked to the
top side, Desmond's place in the field. Comparatively
fresh, seeing the glorious opportunity, grasping it, hugging
it, C&aelig;sar swooped on the ball. He had the heels of any
boy on the opposite side. Down the field he sped, faster
and faster, amid the roars of the School, roars which came
to his ears like the deep booming of breakers upon a lee
shore. To many of those watching him, the sight of that
graceful figure, that shining, ardent face, revealing the
promise which youth and beauty always offer to a delighted
world, became an ineffaceable memory. Damer turned
to the Head of his house.</p>

<p>"And Desmond ought to be one of <i>us</i>," he groaned.</p>

<p>And now C&aelig;sar had passed all forwards. If he keeps his
wits a base is certain. The full back alone lies between
him and triumph. But this is the moment, the psychological
moment, when one tiny mistake will prove irrevocable.
The Head of Damer's whispers as much to
Damer, who smiles sadly.</p>

<p>"His father's son will not blunder now," he replies.</p>

<p>Nor does he. The mistake&mdash;for mistake there must
be on one side or t'other&mdash;is made by Damer's back. As
the ball rolls halfway between them, the back hesitates
and falters.</p>

<p>One base to two&mdash;and eighteen minutes to play!</p>

<p>The second base was kicked by Scaife five minutes later.</p>

<p>By this time the School knew that they were looking
on at a cock-house match, not a semi-final. It was the
wealth of Dives against the widow's mite that the winner
of this match would defeat easily either of the two remaining
houses. And not a man or boy on the ground could
name with any conviction the better eleven. The betting
languished at evens.</p>

<p>Moreover, both sides were playing "canny," risking
nothing, nursing their energies for the last furious five
minutes. Damer began to fidget; than he dropped out
of the front rank of spectators. He couldn't stand still<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
to see his boys win&mdash;or lose. He paced up and down
behind the fags, who winked at each other.</p>

<p>"Damer's got the needle," they whispered.</p>

<p>Dumbleton, however, stood still; a graven image of
High Life below Stairs.</p>

<p>"What do you think, Dumber?" asked Fluff.</p>

<p>"I think, my lord," replied Dumber, solemnly, "that
every minute improves our chance, but if it goes on <i>much</i>
longer," he added phlegmatically, "I shall fall down dead.
My 'eart's weak, my lord."</p>

<p>This was an ancient joke delivered by Dumber as if it
were brand-new, and received by the fags in a like spirit.</p>

<p>"Bless you, you've got no heart, Dumber. It's turned
into tummy long ago," or, in scathing accents, "It's not
your heart that's out of whack, Dumber, but your blithering
old headpiece. What a pity you can't buy a new one!"
and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>Very soon, however, this chaff ceased. Excitement
began to shake the spectators. They felt it up and down
their spinal columns; it formed itself into lumps in their
throats; it gave one or two cramp in the calves of their
legs; it reddened many cheeks and whitened as many
more. The Caterpillar pulled out his watch.</p>

<p>"Three and a half minutes," he announced in a voice
which fell like the crack of doom upon the silent crowd.
If they could have cheered or chaffed! But the absolute
equality of the last desperate struggle prevented any
demonstration. The ball was worried through a scrimmage,
escaped to the right, slid out to the left, only to be
returned whence it came. It seemed as if both sides were
unable to kick it, and when kicked it seemed to refuse to
move as if weighted by the ever-increasing burden of
suspense....</p>

<p>"Now&mdash;now's your chance!" yelled the Manorites.
To their flaming senses the ball appeared to be lying, a
huge blurred sphere, upon the muddy grass; and the
Elevens were stupidly staring at it. The Saints be praised!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span>
Some fellow can move. Who is it? The players, big and
little, are so daubed with mud from head to foot as to be
unrecognizable. Ah-h-h! It's young Verney.</p>

<p>"Good kid! Well played&mdash;I say, well played, well
pla-a-a-a-yed!"</p>

<p>Our John has, it seems, distinguished himself. He
has charged valiantly into the captain of Damer's at the
moment when that illustrious chief is about to kick the ball
to a trusted lieutenant on the left. He succeeds in kicking
the ball into John's face. John goes over backwards;
but the ball falls just in front of the Duffer.</p>

<p>"Kick it, Duffer&mdash;kick it, you old ass!"</p>

<p>The Duffer kicks it most accurately, kicks it well out
to the top side. Now, can Desmond repeat his amazing
performance? Yes&mdash;No&mdash;he can't. The conditions are
no longer the same. Half a dozen fellows are between him
and the Damer base.</p>

<p>Alas! The Manor is about to receive a second object-lesson
upon the fatuity of trusting to individuals. Confident
in C&aelig;sar's ability to take the ball at least within
kicking distance of the base, they have rushed forward,
leaving unguarded their own citadel. C&aelig;sar, going too
fast, misjudges the distance between himself and the back.
A second later the ball is well on its way to the Manor's
base. The back awaits it, coolly enough; knowing that
Damer's forwards are offside. Then he kicks the sodden,
slippery ball&mdash;hard. An exclamation of horror bursts
from the Manorites. Their back has kicked the ball
straight into the hands of the Damerite captain, the
steadiest player on the ground.</p>

<p>"<i>Yards!</i>"</p>

<p>The chief collects himself for a decisive effort, and then
despatches the ball straight and true for the target.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It passed between the posts within forty-five seconds of
time.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER V</h2>

<h3><i>Fellowship</i></h3>

<p class="block1">"Fellowship is Heaven, and the lack of it is Hell."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">John was</span> squelching through the mud, wondering whether
his nose was broken or not, when Lawrence touched his
shoulder.</p>

<p>"Never mind, Verney," he said cheerily; "the Manor
will be cock-house at Torpids next year, and I venture to
prophesy that you'll be Captain."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks, Lawrence," said John.</p>

<p>But, much as he appreciated this tribute from the great
man, and much as it served to mitigate the pangs of defeat,
a yet happier stroke of fortune was about to befall him.
Desmond, who always walked up from the football field
with Scaife, conferred upon John the honour of his
company.</p>

<p>"Where's Scaife?" said John.</p>

<p>"The Demon is demoniac," said Desmond. "He's
lost his hair, and he blames me. Well, I did my best, and
so did he, and there's no more to be said. It's a bore that
we shall be too old to play next year. I told the Demon
that if we had to be beaten, I would sooner take a licking
from Damer's than any other house; and he told me that
he believed I wanted 'em to win. When a fellow's in that
sort of blind rage, I call him dotty, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes," said John.</p>

<p>"You played jolly well, Verney; I expect Lawrence
told you so."</p>

<p>"He did say something decent," John replied.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar joined them as they were passing
through the stile. "We should have won," he said deliberately,
"if the Demon hadn't behaved like a rank outsider."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Scaife is my pal," said Desmond, hotly.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar shrugged his shoulders, and held high
his well-cut, aquiline nose, as he murmured&mdash;</p>

<p>"One doesn't pretend to be a Christian, but as a gentleman
one accepts a bit of bad luck without gnashing one's
teeth. What? That Spartan boy with the fox was a
well bred 'un, you can take my word for it. Scaife
isn't."</p>

<p>The Caterpillar joined another pair of boys before
Desmond could reply. John looked uncomfortable. Then
Desmond burst out with Irish vehemence&mdash;</p>

<p>"Egerton is always jawing about breeding. It's rather
snobbish. I don't think the worse of Scaife because his
grandfather carried a hod. The Egertons have been living
at Mount Egerton ever since they left Mount Ararat, but
what have they done? And he ought to make allowances
for the old Demon. He was simply mad keen to win this
match, and he has a temper. You like him, Verney,
don't you?"</p>

<p>John hesitated, realizing that to speak the truth would
offend the one fellow in the school whom he wished to
please and conciliate. Then he blurted out&mdash;</p>

<p>"No&mdash;I don't."</p>

<p>"You don't?" Desmond's frank, blue eyes, Irish eyes,
deeply blue, with black lashes encircling them, betrayed
amazement and curiosity&mdash;so John thought&mdash;rather than
anger. "You don't?" he continued. "Why not? The
old Demon likes you; he says you got him out of a tight
place. Why don't you like him, Verney?"</p>

<p>John's mind had to speculate vaguely whether or not
Desmond knew the nature of the tight place&mdash;<i>tight</i> was
such a very descriptive adjective&mdash;out of which he had
pulled Scaife. Then he said nervously&mdash;</p>

<p>"I don't like him because&mdash;because he likes&mdash;you."</p>

<p>"Likes me? What a rum 'un you are, Verney! Why
shouldn't he like me?"</p>

<p>"Because," said John, boldly meeting the emergency<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
with the conviction that he had burnt his ships, and must
advance without fear, "because he's not half good enough
for you."</p>

<p>Desmond burst out laughing; the clear, ringing laugh
of his father, which had often allayed an incipient mutiny
below the gangway, and charmed aside the impending
disaster of a snatch-division. And it is on <i>one's own side</i>
in the House of Commons that good temper tells pre-eminently.</p>

<p>"Not good enough for me!" he repeated. "Thanks
awfully. Evidently you have a high opinion of&mdash;<i>me</i>."</p>

<p>"Yes," said John.</p>

<p>The quiet monosyllable, so soberly, so seriously uttered,
challenged Desmond's attention. He stared for a moment
at John's face&mdash;not an attractive object. Blood and mud
disfigured it. But the grey eyes met the blue unwaveringly.
Desmond flushed.</p>

<p>"You've stuck me on a sort of pedestal." His tone
was as serious as John's.</p>

<p>"Yes," said John.</p>

<p>They were opposite the Music Schools. The other
Manorites had run on. For the moment they stood alone,
ten thousand leagues from Harrow, alone in those sublimated
spaces where soul meets soul unfettered by flesh.
Afterwards, not then, John knew that this was so. He met
the real Desmond for the first time, and Desmond met the
real John in a thoroughfare other than that which leads
to the Manor, other than that which leads to any house
built by human hands, upon the shining highway of
Heaven.</p>

<p>Shall we try to set down Desmond's feelings at this
crisis? Till now, his life had run gaily through fragrant
gardens, so to speak: pleasaunces full of flowers, of
sweet-smelling herbs, of stately trees, a paradise indeed
from which the ugly, the crude, the harmful had been
rigorously excluded. Happy the boy who has such a home
as was allotted to Harry Desmond! And from it, ever<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
since he could remember, he had received tender love,
absolute trust, the traditions of a great family whose name
was part of English history, an exquisite refinement, and
with these, the gratification of all reasonable desires. And
this magnificent upbringing shone out of his radiant face,
the inexpressible charm of youth unspotted&mdash;white.
Scaife's upbringing, of which you shall know more presently,
had been far different, and yet he, the cynic and the unclean,
recognized the God in Harry Desmond. He had
not, for instance, told Desmond of the nature of that
"tight" place; he had kept a guard over his tongue; he
had interposed his own strong will between his friend and
such attention as a boy of Desmond's attractiveness might
provoke from Lovell senior and the like. It is true that
Scaife was well aware that without these precautions he
would have lost his friend; none the less, above and beyond
this consciousness hovered the higher, more subtle intuition
that the good in Desmond was something not lightly to be
tampered with, something awe-inspiring; the more so
because, poor fellow! he had never encountered it before.</p>

<p>Desmond stood still, with his eyes upon John's discoloured
face. Not the least of C&aelig;sar's charms was his
lack of self-consciousness. Now, for the first time, he tried
to see himself as John saw him&mdash;on a pedestal. And so
strong was John's ideal that in a sense Desmond did catch
a glimpse of himself as John saw him. And then followed
a rapid comparison, first between the real and the ideal,
and secondly between himself and Scaife. His face broke
into a smile.</p>

<p>"Why, Verney," he exclaimed, "you mustn't turn me
into a sort of Golden Calf. And as for Scaife not being
good enough for me, why, he's miles ahead of me in everything.
He's cleverer, better at games, ten thousand times
better looking, and one day he'll be a big power, and I
shall always be a poor man. Why, I&mdash;I don't mind telling
you that I used to keep out of Scaife's way, although he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
was always awfully civil to me, because he has so much
and I so little."</p>

<p>"He's not half good enough for you," repeated John,
with the Verney obstinacy. Unwittingly he slightly
emphasized the "good."</p>

<p>"Good? Do you mean 'pi'? He's not <i>that</i>, thank
the Lord!"</p>

<p>This made John laugh, and Desmond joined in. Now
they were Harrow boys again, within measurable distance
of the Yard, although still in the shadow of the Spire. The
Demon described as "pi" tickled their ribs.</p>

<p>"You must learn to like the Demon," Desmond continued,
as they moved on. Then, as John said nothing,
he added quickly, "He and I have made up our minds not
to try for remove this term. You see, next term is the
jolliest term of the year&mdash;cricket and 'Ducker'<a name="FNanchor_19_19" id="FNanchor_19_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_19" class="fnanchor">[19]</a> and
Lord's. And we shall know the form's swat thoroughly,
and have time to enjoy ourselves. You'll be with us.
Your remove is a 'cert'&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>John beamed. He had made certain that C&aelig;sar would
be in the Third Fifth next term and hopelessly out of reach.</p>

<p>"Oh yes, I shall get my remove. So will the Caterpillar."</p>

<p>"Hang the Caterpillar," said Desmond.</p>

<p>"He'd ask for a silken rope, as Lord Ferrers did," said
John, with one of his unexpected touches of humour.
Again Desmond bent his head in the gesture John knew
so well, and laughed.</p>

<p>"I say, Verney, you <i>are</i> a joker. Well, the old Caterpillar's
a good sort, but he's not fair to Scaife. Here we
are!"</p>

<p>They ran upstairs to "tosh" and change. John found
the Duffer just slipping out of his ducks. He looked at
John with a rueful grin.</p>

<p>"Are you going to chuck me?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Chuck you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fluff says you've chucked him. He was in here a
moment ago to ask if your nose was squashed. I believe
the silly little ass thinks you the greatest thing on earth."</p>

<p>"I don't chuck anybody," said John, indignantly.
And he made a point of asking Fluff to walk with him on
Sunday.</p>

<p>After the Torpid matches the school settled down to
train (more or less) for the athletic sports. John came to
grief several times at Kenton brook, essaying to jump it at
places obviously&mdash;as the Duffer pointed out&mdash;beyond his
stride. The Duffer and he put their names down for the
house-handicaps, and curtailed their visits to the Creameries.
After this self-denial it is humiliating to record that
neither boy succeeded in winning anything. C&aelig;sar won
the house mile handicap; Scaife won the under sixteen
high jump&mdash;a triumph for the Manor; and Fluff, the
despised Fluff, actually secured an immense tankard, which
one of the Sixth offered as a prize because he was quite
convinced that his own particular pal would win it. The
distance happened to be half a mile. Fluff was allowed
an enormous start and won in a canter.</p>

<p>The term came to an end soon after these achievements,
and John spent a week of the holidays at White
Ladies, the Duke of Trent's Shropshire place. Here, for
the first time, he saw that august and solemn personage,
a Groom of the Chambers, with carefully-trimmed whiskers,
a white tie, a silky voice, and the appearance of an archdeacon.
This visit is recorded because it made a profound
impression upon a plastic mind. John had never sat in the
seats of the mighty. Verney Boscobel was a delightful
old house, but it might have been put, stables and all,
into White Ladies, and never found again. Fluff showed
John the famous Reynolds and Gainsborough portraits,
the Van Dycks and Lelys, the Romneys and Richmonds.
Fair women and brave men smiled or frowned at our hero
wherever he turned his wondering eyes. After the first
tour of the great galleries, he turned to his companion.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>"I say," he whispered solemnly, "some of 'em look
as if they didn't like my calling you&mdash;Fluff."</p>

<p>"I wish you'd call me Esm&eacute;."</p>

<p>"All right," said John, "I will; and&mdash;er&mdash;although
you didn't get into the Torpids, you can call me&mdash;John."</p>

<p>"Oh, John, thanks awfully."</p>

<p>Ponies were provided for the boys to ride, and they
shot rabbits in the Chase. Also, they appeared at dinner,
a tremendous function, and were encouraged by some of
the younger guests to spar (verbally, of course) with the
duke's Etonian sons. Fluff looked so much stronger and
happier that his parents, delighted with their experiment,
were inclined to cry up the Hill, much to the exasperation
of the dwellers in the Plain.</p>

<p>When he left White Ladies John had learned one valuable
lesson. His sense of that hackneyed phrase, <i>noblesse
oblige</i>, the sense which remains nonsense with so many
boys (old and young), had been quickened. Little more
than a child in many ways, he realized, as a man does, the
true significance of rank and wealth. The Duke of Trent
had married a pleasure-loving dame; White Ladies was
essentially a pleasure-house, to which came gladly enough
the wit and beauty of the kingdom. And yet the duke,
not clever as compared to his guests, not even good-looking
as compared to the splendid gentlemen whom Van Dyck
and Lely had painted, <i>undistinguished</i>, in fine, in everything
save rank and wealth, worked, early and late, harder than
any labourer upon his vast domain. And when John said
to Fluff, "I say, Esm&eacute;, why does the duke work so beastly
hard?" Fluff replied with emphasis, "Why, because
he has to, you know. It's no joke to be born a duke,
and I'm jolly glad that I'm a younger son. Father says
that he has no amusements, but plenty of occupation.
Mother says he's the unpaid land-agent of the Trent
property."</p>

<p>John went back to Verney Boscobel, and repeated what
Fluff had said, as his own.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>"It was simply splendid, mum, like a sort of castle in
fairyland and all that, but I <i>am</i> glad I'm not a duke. And
I expect that even an earl has a lot of beastly jobs to do
which never bother <i>us</i>."</p>

<p>"Oh, you've found that out, have you, John? Well,
I hesitated when the invitation came; but I'm glad now
that you went."</p>

<p>"Yes; and it's ripping to be home again."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The summer term began in glorious sunshine; and
John forgot that he owned an umbrella. The Caterpillar
and he had achieved their remove, but the unhappy Duffer
was left behind alone with the hideous necessity of doing
his form's work by himself. The boys occupied the same
rooms, but John prepared his Greek and Latin with Scaife,
C&aelig;sar, and the Caterpillar; whom he was now privileged
to call by their nick-names. They began to call him John,
hearing young Kinloch do so; and then one day, Scaife,
looking up with his derisive smile, said&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm going to call you Jonathan."</p>

<p>"Good," said Desmond. "All the same, we can't
call either the Duffer or Fluff&mdash;David, can we?"</p>

<p>"I was not thinking of Kinloch or Duff," said Scaife,
staring hard at John. And John alone knew that Scaife
read him like a book, in which he was contemptuously
amused&mdash;nothing more. After that, as if Scaife's will
were law, the others called John&mdash;Jonathan.</p>

<p>Very soon, the sun was obscured by ever-thickening
clouds. John happened to provoke the antipathy of a
lout in his form known as Lubber Sprott. Sprott began to
persecute him with a series of petty insults and injuries.
He accused him of "sucking up" to a lord, of putting
on "lift" because he was the youngest boy in the Upper
Remove, of kow-towing to the masters&mdash;and so forth.
Then, finding these repeated gibes growing stale, he resorted
to meaner methods. He upset ink on John's books, or
kicked them from under his arm as he was going up to the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
New Schools. He put a "dringer"<a name="FNanchor_20_20" id="FNanchor_20_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_20" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> into the pocket of
John's "bluer."<a name="FNanchor_21_21" id="FNanchor_21_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_21" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> He pinched him unmercifully if he
found himself next to John in form, knowing that John
would not betray him. When occasion offered he kicked
John. In short, he was successful in taking all the fun and
sparkle out of the merrie month of May.</p>

<p>Finally, C&aelig;sar got an inkling of what was going on.</p>

<p>"Is Sprott ragging you?" he asked point-blank.</p>

<p>"Ye-es," said John, blushing. "It's n-nothing," he
added nervously. "He'll get tired of it, I expect."</p>

<p>"I saw him kick you," said Desmond, frowning. "Now,
look here, Jonathan, you kick him; kick him as hard
as ever you can where, where he kicks you&mdash;eh? And
do it to-morrow in the Yard, at nine Bill, when everybody
is looking on. You can dodge into the crowd; but if
I were you I'd kick him at the very moment he gets into
line, and then he can't pursue. And if he does pursue&mdash;which
I'll bet you a bob he don't, he'll have to tackle you
and me."</p>

<p>"I'll do it," said John.</p>

<p>Next day, a whole holiday, at nine Bill, both C&aelig;sar and
John were standing close to the window of Custos' den,
waiting for Lubber Sprott to appear. While waiting, an
incident occurred which must be duly chronicled inasmuch
as it has direct bearing upon this story. Only the week
before Rutford had come up to the Yard late for Bill, he
being the master whose turn it was to call over. Such
tardiness, which happens seldom, is reckoned as an unpardonable
sin by Harrow boys. Briefly it means that six
hundred suffer from the unpunctuality of one. Therefore,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[79]</a></span>
when Rutford appeared, slightly flushed of countenance
and visibly annoyed, the School emphasized their displeasure
by derisive cheers. Rutford, ever tactless where
boys were concerned, was unwise enough to make a speech
from the steps condemning, in his usual bombastic style,
a demonstration which he ought to have known he was
quite powerless to punish or to prevent. When he had
finished, the School cheered more derisively than before.
After Bill, he left the Yard, purple with rage and humiliation.</p>

<p>Upon this particular morning, one of the younger
masters, Basil Warde, was calling Bill. The School knew
little of Warde, save that he was an Old Harrovian in charge
of a Small House, and that his form reported him&mdash;<i>queer</i>.
He had instituted a queer system of punishments, he made
queer remarks, he looked queer: in fine, he was generally
regarded as a radical, and therefore a person to be watched
with suspicion by boys who, as a body, are intensely
conservative. He was of a clear red complexion with
lapis-lazuli blue eyes, that peculiar blue which is the colour
of the sea on a bright, stormy day. The Upper School
knew that, as a member of the Alpine Club, Warde had
conquered half a dozen hitherto unconquerable peaks.</p>

<p>Into the Yard and into this book Warde comes late.
As he hurried to his place, the School greeted him as they
had greeted Rutford only the week before. If anything,
the demonstration was slightly more hostile. That Bill
should be delayed twice within ten days was unheard-of
and outrageous. When the hoots and cheers subsided,
Warde held up his hand. He smiled, and his chin stuck
out, and his nose stuck up at an angle familiar to those who
had scaled peaks in his company. In silence, the School
awaited what he had to say, hoping that he might slate
them, which would afford an excuse for more ragging.
Warde, guessing, perhaps, the wish of the crowd, smiled
more genially than before. Then, in a loud, clear voice,
he said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"I beg pardon for being late. And I thank you for
cheering me. I haven't been cheered in the Yard since the
afternoon when I got my Flannels."</p>

<p>A deafening roar of applause broke from the boys.
Warde might be queer, but he was a good sort, a gentleman,
and, henceforward, popular with Harrovians.</p>

<p>He began to call over as Lubber Sprott neared the place
where Desmond and John awaited him. The Lubber took
up his position near the boys, turning a broad back to them.
He stood with his hands in his pockets, talking to another
boy as big and stupid as himself. The Lubber, it may be
added, ought to have worn "Charity" tails, but he had not
applied for permission to do so. He was fat and gross
rather than tall, and certainly too large for his clothes.</p>

<p>"Now," said C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>John measured the distance with his eye, as C&aelig;sar
thoughtfully nudged other members of the Upper Remove.
John had room for a very short run. The Lubber was
swaying backwards and forwards. John timed his kick,
which for a small boy he delivered with surprising force,
so accurately that the Lubber fell on his face. The boys
looking on screamed with laughter. The Lubber, picking
himself up (John dodged into the crowd, who received him
joyfully) and glaring round, encountered the contemptuous
face of Desmond.</p>

<p>"Let me have a shot," said C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>The Lubber advanced, spluttering with rage.</p>

<p>"Where is he&mdash;where is he, that infernal young Verney?"</p>

<p>By this time fifty boys at least were interested spectators
of the scene. Desmond stood square in the Lubber's path.</p>

<p>"You like to kick small boys," said C&aelig;sar, in a very
loud voice. "I'm small, half your size, why don't you
kick me?"</p>

<p>The Lubber could have crushed the speaker by mere
weight; but he hesitated, and the harder he stared at
Desmond the less he fancied the job of kicking him.
Quality confronted quantity.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Kick me," said Desmond, "if&mdash;if you dare, you big,
hulking coward and cad!"</p>

<p>"Come on, Lubber, get into line!" shouted some boy.</p>

<p>Sprott turned slowly, glancing over his vast, fat shoulder
to guard against further assault. Then he took his place
in the line, and passed slowly out of the Yard and out of
these pages. He never persecuted John again.<a name="FNanchor_22_22" id="FNanchor_22_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_22" class="fnanchor">[22]</a></p>

<p>Not yet, however, was the sun to shine in John's firmament.
As the days lengthened, as June touched all hearts
with her magic fingers, insensibly relaxing the tissues and
warming the senses, John became more and more miserably
aware that, in the fight between Scaife and himself for the
possession of Desmond, the odds were stupendously against
him. Truly the Demon had the subtlety of the serpent,
for he used the failings which he was unable to hide as
cords wherewith to bind his friend more closely to him.
When the facts, for instance, of what had taken place in
Lovell's room came to Desmond's ears, he denied fiercely
the possibility of Scaife, his pal, making a "beast" of
himself. The laughter which greeted his passionate protest
sent him hot-foot to Scaife himself.</p>

<p>"They say," panted C&aelig;sar, "that last winter you were
dead drunk in Lovell's room. I told the beasts they
lied."</p>

<p>Scaife's handsome face softened. Was he touched by
C&aelig;sar's loyalty? Who can tell? Always he subordinated
emotion to intelligence: head commanded heart.</p>

<p>"Perhaps they did," he answered steadily; "and
perhaps they didn't. I deny nothing; I admit nothing.
But"&mdash;his fine eyes, so dark and piercing, flamed&mdash;"C&aelig;sar,
if I was dead drunk at your feet now, would you turn away
from me, would you chuck me?"</p>

<p>Desmond winced. Scaife pursued his advantage.</p>

<p>"If you <i>are</i> that sort of a fellow&mdash;the Pharisee"&mdash;Desmond
winced again&mdash;"the saint who is too pure, too<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
holy, to associate with a sinner, say so, and let us part
here&mdash;and now. For I <i>am</i> a&mdash;sinner. You are not a
sinner. Hold hard! let me have my say. I've always
known that this moment was coming. Yes, I am a sinner.
And my governor is a sinner, a hardened sinner. His
father made our pile by what you would call robbery.
The whole world knows it, and condones it, because we are
so rich. Even my mother&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>He paused, trembling, white to the lips.</p>

<p>"Don't," said Desmond. "Please don't."</p>

<p>"You're right. I won't. But I'm handicapped on
both sides. It's only fair that you should know what sort
of a fellow you've chosen for a pal. And it's not too late
to chuck me. Rutford will put Verney in here, if I ask him.
And, by God! I'm in the mood to ask him <i>now</i>. Shall I
go to him, Desmond, or shall I stay?"</p>

<p>He had never raised his voice, but it fell upon the
sensitive soul of the boy facing him as if it were a clarion-call
to battle.</p>

<p>Desmond sprang forward, ardent, eager, afire with
generous self-surrender.</p>

<p>"Forgive me," he cried. "Oh, forgive me, because I
can't forgive myself!"</p>

<p>After this breaking of barriers, Scaife took less pains to
disguise a nature which turned as instinctively to darkness
as Desmond's to light. A score of times protest died when
Scaife murmured, "There I go again, forgetting the gulf
between us"; and always Desmond swore stoutly that the
gulf, if a gulf did yawn between them, should be bridged
by friendship and hope. But, insensibly, C&aelig;sar's ideals
became tainted by Scaife's materialism. Scaife, for instance,
spent money lavishly upon "food" and clothes.
So far as a Public Schoolboy is able, he never denied his
splendid young body anything it coveted. Desmond, too
proud to receive favours without returning them, tried to
vie with this reckless spendthrift, and found himself in
debt. In other ways a keen eye and ear would have<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
marked deterioration. John noticed that C&aelig;sar laughed,
although he never sneered, at things he used to hold sacred;
that he condemned, as Scaife did, whatever that clever
young reprobate was pleased to stigmatize as narrow-minded
or intolerant.</p>

<p>Cricket, however, kept them fairly straight. Each
was certain to get his "cap,"<a name="FNanchor_23_23" id="FNanchor_23_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_23" class="fnanchor">[23]</a> if, as Lawrence told them,
they stuck to the rigour of the game. This was Lawrence's
last term. He had stayed on to play at Lord's, and when
he left Trieve would become the Head of the House&mdash;a
prospect very pleasing to the turbulent Fifth.</p>

<p>About the middle of June John suffered a parlous
blow. He was never so happy as when he was sitting in
Scaife's room, cheek by jowl with Desmond, sharing,
perhaps, a "dringer," poring over the same dictionary.
This delightful intimacy came to a sudden end in this wise.
The form-master of the Upper Remove happened to be a
precisian in English. A sure road to his favour was the
right use of a word. The Demon, appreciating this, bought
a dictionary of synonyms, and made a point of discarding
the commonplace and obvious, substituting a phrase likely
to elicit praise and marks. Desmond and John joined
in this hunt of the right word with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>One evening the four boys encountered the simple
sentence&mdash;"<i>majoris pretii quam quod &aelig;stimari possit</i>."</p>

<p>"'Priceless''ll cover that," said C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>"Or 'inest<i>ee</i>mable,'" said the Demon.</p>

<p>The three other boys stared at the Demon, and then
at each other. The Caterpillar, something of a purist in
his way, drawled out&mdash;</p>

<p>"One pronounces that 'inestimable.'"</p>

<p>"My father doesn't," said Scaife, hotly. "I've heard
him say 'inesteemable.'"</p>

<p>"No doubt," said Egerton, coldly. "How does <i>your</i>
father pronounce it, C&aelig;sar?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span></p>

<p>Desmond said hurriedly, "Oh, 'inestimable'; but what
does it matter?"</p>

<p>The Demon sprang up, furious. "It matters this,"
he cried. "I'm d&mdash;&mdash;d if I'll have Egerton sitting in my
room sneering at my governor. After this he'll do his
work in his own room, or I'll do mine in the passage."</p>

<p>Before Desmond could speak, Scaife had whirled out of
the room, slamming the door. John looked stupefied with
dismay.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar shrugged his shoulders. Then he said
slowly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Scaife's father pronounces 'connoisseur' 'connoysure,'
and so does Scaife."</p>

<p>Desmond stood up, flushed and distressed, but emphatic.</p>

<p>"Scaife is right about one thing," he said. "He
won't sit here like a cad and listen to Egerton sneering at
his father. I'm very sorry, but after this we'd better
split up. Verney and you, Egerton; and Scaife and I."</p>

<p>"Certainly," said the Caterpillar, rising in his turn.</p>

<p>Poor John cast a distracted and imploring glance at
Desmond, which flashed by unheeded. Then he got up,
and followed the Caterpillar out of the room. The passage
was empty.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar sniffed as if the atmosphere in Scaife's
room had been polluted.</p>

<p>"One has nothing to regret," he remarked. "Scaife
has good points, and&mdash;er&mdash;bad. You've noticed his hands&mdash;eh!
<i>Very</i> unfinished! And his foot&mdash;short, but broad."
The Caterpillar surveyed his long, slender feet with infinite
satisfaction; then he added, with an accent of finality,
"Scaife talks about going into the Grenadiers; but they'll
give him a hot time there, a very hot time. One is really
sorry for the poor fellow, because, of course, he can't help
being a bounder. What does puzzle me is, why did C&aelig;sar
want such a fellow for his pal?"</p>

<p>"But he didn't," said John.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span></p>

<p>"Eh?&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Scaife wanted C&aelig;sar," John explained. "And I've
noticed, Caterpillar, that whatever Scaife wants he gets."</p>

<p>"He wants breeding, Jonathan, but he'll never get that&mdash;never."</p>

<p>After this, John saw but little of Desmond; and Scaife
hardly spoke to him. Accordingly, much of our hero's
time was spent in the company of the Duffer and Fluff.
The three passed many delightful hours together at
"Ducker." Armed with buns and chocolate, they would
rush down the hill, bathe, lie about on the grass, eat the
buns, and chaff the kids who were learning to swim.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 15em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Long, long, in the misty hereafter<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shall echo, in ears far away,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The lilt of that innocent laughter,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The splash of the spray."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>During the School matches they spent the afternoons
on the Sixth Form ground, carefully criticizing every
stroke. The theory of the game lay pat to the tongue, but
in practice John was a shocking bungler. At his small
preparatory school in the New Forest, he had not been
taught the elementary principles of either racquets or
cricket; but he had a good eye, played a capital game of
golf, rode and shot well for a small boy. Fluff, although
still delicate, gave promise of being a cricketer as good,
possibly, as his brothers, when he became stronger.</p>

<p>Upon Speech Day John's mother and uncle came down
to Harrow, and you may be sure that John escorted them
in triumph to the Manor. Mrs. Verney has since confessed
that John's expression as she greeted him surprised and
distressed her. He looked quite unhappy. And the dear
woman, thinking that he must be in debt, seriously considered
the propriety of tipping him handsomely <i>in advance</i>.
A moment later, as she slipped out of an old and shabby
dust-cloak, revealing the splendours of a dress fresh from
Paris, she divined from John's now radiant face what had
troubled him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span></p>

<p>"John," she said, "you didn't really think that I was going
to shame you by wearing this dreadful cloak&mdash;did you?"</p>

<p>"I wasn't quite sure," John answered; then he burst
out, "Mum, you look simply lovely. All the fellows will
take you for my sister."</p>

<p>And after the great function in Speech-room came the
cheering. How John's heart throbbed when the Head of
the School, standing just outside the door, proclaimed the
illustrious name&mdash;</p>

<p>"Three cheers for Mr. John Verney."</p>

<p>And how the boys in the road below cheered, as the
little man descended the steps, hat in hand, bowing and
blushing! Everybody knew that he was on the eve of
departure for further explorations in Manchuria. He
would be absent, so the papers said, three years at least.
The School cheered the louder, because each boy knew that
they might never see that gallant face again.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon a selection of Harrow songs was
given in the Speech-room. "Five Hundred Faces," as
usual, was sung by a new boy, who is answered, in chorus,
by the whole School. How John recalled his own feelings,
less than a year ago, as he stood shivering upon the bank
of the river, funking the first plunge! And his uncle, now
sitting beside him, had said that he would soon enjoy
himself amazingly&mdash;and so he had! The new boy began
the second verse. His voice, not a strong one, quavered
shrilly&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"A quarter to seven! There goes the bell!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The sleet is driving against the pane;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">But woe to the sluggard who turns again<br /></span>
<span class="i0">And sleeps, not wisely, but all too well!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>In reply to the weak, timid notes came the glad roar
of the School&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 20em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Yet the time may come, as the years go by,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When your heart will thrill<br /></span>

<span class="i0">And the pitiless bell, with its piercing cry!"<br /></span>
<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span></div></div></div>

<p>Ah, that pitiless bell! And yet because of it one
wallowed in Sunday and whole-holiday "frowsts."<a name="FNanchor_24_24" id="FNanchor_24_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_24" class="fnanchor">[24]</a>
John, you see, had the makings of a philosopher. And
now the Eleven were grunting "Willow the King." And
when the last echo of the chorus died away in the great
room, Uncle John whispered to his nephew that he had
heard Harrow songs in every corner of the earth, and that
convincing proof of merit shone out of the fact that their
charm waxed rather than waned with the years; they
improved, like wine, with age.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar's father came down with the Duke of Trent.
The duke tipped John magnificently and asked him to
spend his exeat at Trent House, and to witness the Eton
and Harrow match at Lord's from the Trent coach. John
accepted gratefully enough; but his heart was sore because,
just before the row over that infernal word "inestimable,"
C&aelig;sar had asked John if he would like to occupy an attic
in Eaton Square. After the row nothing more was said
about the attic; but John would have preferred bare boards
in Eaton Square to a tapestried chamber in Park
Lane.</p>

<p>Now, during the whole of this summer term there was
much animated discussion in regard to the rival claims of
lines or spots upon the white waistcoat worn by all self-respecting
Harrovians at Lord's. Upon this important
subject John had betrayed scandalous indifference. Accordingly,
just before the match, the Caterpillar took him
aside and spoke a solemn word.</p>

<p>"Look here," he said; "one doesn't as a rule make
personal remarks, but it's rather too obvious that you buy
your clothes in Lyndhurst. I was sorry to see that the
Duke of Trent was the worst-dressed man at Speecher;
but a duke can look like a tinker, and nobody cares."</p>

<p>"I'd be awfully obliged if you'd tell me what's wrong,"
said John, humbly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span></p>

<p>"Everything's wrong," said the Caterpillar, decisively.
He looked critically at John's boots. "Your boots, for
instance&mdash;most excellent boots for wading through the
swamps in the New Forest, but quite impossible in town.
And the 'topper' you wear on Sunday! Southampton,
you say? Ah, I thought it was a Verney heirloom.
Now, it wouldn't surprise me to hear that your mother,
who dresses herself quite charmingly, bought your kit."</p>

<p>"She did," John confessed.</p>

<p>"Just so. One need say no more. Now, you come
along with me."</p>

<p>They marched down the High Street to the most
fashionable of the School tailors, where John was measured
for an Eton jacket of the best, white waistcoat with blue
spots, light bags; while the Caterpillar selected a new
"topper," an umbrella, a pair of gloves, and a tie.</p>

<p>"Be <i>very</i> careful about the bags," said the Caterpillar.
"They are cutting 'em in town a trifle tighter about the
lower leg, but loose above. You understand?"</p>

<p>"Perfectly, Mr. Egerton," replied the obsequious snip.
"What we call the 'tighto-looso' style, sir."</p>

<p>"I don't think they call it that in Savile Row," said the
Caterpillar; "but be careful."</p>

<p>The tailor was assured that he would receive an order
properly signed by Mr. Rutford. And then John was led
to the bootmaker's, and there measured for his first pair
of patent-leathers. The Caterpillar was so exhausted by
these labours that a protracted visit to the Creameries
became imperative.</p>

<p>"You've always looked like a gentleman," said the
Caterpillar, after his "dringer," "and it's a comfort to me
to think that now you'll be dressed like one."</p>

<p>So John went up to town looking very smart indeed;
and Fluff (who had ordered a similar kit) whispered to John
at luncheon that his brothers, the Etonians, had expressed
surprise at the change for the better in their general
appearance.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span></p>

<p>This luncheon was eaten on the top of the duke's coach,
and it happened that the next coach but one belonged to
Scaife's father. John could just see Scaife's handsome head,
and C&aelig;sar sitting beside him. The boys nodded to each
other, and the Etonians asked questions. At the name of
Scaife, however, the young Kinlochs curled contemptuous
lips.</p>

<p>"Unspeakable bounder, old Scaife, isn't he?" they
asked; and the duchess replied&mdash;</p>

<p>"My dears, his cheques are honoured to any amount,
even if <i>he</i> isn't."</p>

<p>Her laughter tinkled delightfully; but John reflected
that Desmond was eating the Scaife food and drinking the
Scaife wine&mdash;all bought with ill-gotten gold.</p>

<p>Later in the afternoon it became evident that the
Scaife champagne was flowing freely. To John's dismay,
the Harrovians (including C&aelig;sar) on the top of the Scaife
coach became noisy. The Caterpillar and his father,
Colonel Egerton, sauntered up, and were invited by the
duke to rest and refresh themselves. John was amused
to note that the colonel was even a greater buck than
his son. He quite cut out the poor old Caterpillar,
challenging and monopolizing the attention of all who
beheld him.</p>

<p>"Those boys are makin' the devil of a row," said the
colonel, fixing his eyeglass. "Ah, the Scaifes! A man
I know dined with them last week. He reported everything
<i>over</i>done, except the food. Their <i>chef</i> is Marcobruno,
you know."</p>

<p>Presently, to John's relief, Desmond left the Scaifes
and joined the Trent party, upon whom his gay,
radiant face and charming manners made a most
favourable impression. He laughed at the duchess's
stories, and made love to her quite unaffectedly. The
Etonians looked rather glum, because their wickets were
falling faster than had been expected. Desmond told
the duke, in answer to a question, that his father was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
in his seat in the pavilion, with his eyes glued to the
pitch.</p>

<p>"He's awfully keen," said C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>"You boys are not so keen as we were," said the duke,
nodding reflectively.</p>

<p>"Oh, but we are, sir&mdash;indeed we are," said C&aelig;sar.
"Aren't we, Caterpillar?"</p>

<p>The Caterpillar replied, thoughtfully, "One bottles up
that sort of thing, I suppose."</p>

<p>"Ah," said the duke, kindly, "if it's the right sort of
thing, it's none the worse for being bottled up."</p>

<p>The boys went to the play that night and enjoyed themselves
hugely. Next day, however, the match ended in a
draw. John was standing on the top of the coach, very
disconsolate, when he saw Desmond beckoning to him
from below. The expression on C&aelig;sar's face puzzled
him.</p>

<p>"How can you pal up with those Etonians?" whispered
C&aelig;sar, after John had descended. "Every Eton face I see
now I want to hit." Then he added, with a smile and a
chuckle, "I say, there's going to be a ruction in front of
the Pavvy. Come on."</p>

<p>A minute later John was in the thick of a very pretty
scrimmage between the Hill and the Plain. Hats were
bashed in; cornflowers torn from buttonholes; pale-blue
tassels were captured; umbrellas broken. Finally, the
police interfered.</p>

<p>"Short, but very, very sweet," said C&aelig;sar, panting.</p>

<p>John and he were lamentable objects for fond parents
to behold, but the sense of depression had vanished. And
then C&aelig;sar said suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Jove! I <i>have</i> got a bit of news. It quite takes
the sting out of this draw."</p>

<p>"What's happened?"</p>

<p>"My governor has been talking with Warde. Rutford
is leaving Harrow."</p>

<p>John gasped. "That is ripping."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span></p>

<p>"Isn't it? But who do you think is coming to us?
Why, Warde himself. He was at the Manor when it was
<i>the</i> house, and the governor says that Warde will make it
<i>the</i> house, again. He's got his work cut out for him&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"You bet your life," said John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Before the</span> end of the summer term, both Desmond and
Scaife received their "caps" and a word of advice from
Lawrence.</p>

<p>"There are going to be changes here," said he; "and
I wish I could see 'em, and help to bring 'em about. Now,
I'm not given to buttering fellows up, but I see plainly that
the rebuilding of this house depends a lot upon you two.
It's not likely that you're able to measure your influence;
if you could, there wouldn't be much to measure. But take
it from me, not a word, not an action of yours is without
weight with the lower boys. Everything helps or hinders.
Next term there will be war&mdash;to the knife&mdash;between Warde
and some fellows I needn't name, and Warde will win.
Remember I said so. I hope you," he looked hard at
Desmond, "will fight on the right side."</p>

<p>The boys returned to their room, jubilant because the
house-cap was theirs, but uneasy because of the words
given with it. As soon as they were alone, Scaife said
sullenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Does Lawrence expect us to stand in with Warde
against Lovell and his pals? If he does, he's jolly well
mistaken, as far as I'm concerned."</p>

<p>Desmond flushed. He had spent nearly five terms at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
Harrow, but only two at the Manor. Of what had been
done or left undone by certain fellows in the Fifth he was
still in twilight ignorance. He discerned shadows, nothing
more, and, boylike, he ran from shadows into the sunlight.
Desmond knew that there were beasts at the Manor. Had
you forced from him an expression approaching, let
us say, definiteness, he would have admitted that beasts
lurked in every house, in every school in the kingdom.
You must keep out of their way (and ways)&mdash;that was all.
And he knew also that too many beasts wreck a house, as
they wreck a regiment or a nation.</p>

<p>But once or twice within the past few months he had
suspected that his cut-and-dried views on good and evil
were not shared by Scaife. Scaife confessed to Desmond
that the Old Adam was strong in him. He liked, craved for,
the excitement of breaking the law. Hitherto, this breaking
of the law had been confined to such offences as smoking
or drinking a glass of beer at a "pub,"<a name="FNanchor_25_25" id="FNanchor_25_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_25" class="fnanchor">[25]</a> or using cribs, or,
generally speaking, setting at naught authority. That
Scaife had escaped severe punishment was due to his keen
wits.</p>

<p>Now, when Scaife gave Desmond the unexpurgated
history of the row which so nearly resulted in the expulsion
of six boys, Desmond had asked a question&mdash;</p>

<p>"Do you <i>like</i> whisky? I loathe it."</p>

<p>Scaife laughed before he answered. Doubtless one
reason why he exacted interest and admiration from Desmond
lay in a rare (rare at fifteen) ability to analyse his
own and others' actions.</p>

<p>"I loathe it, too," he admitted. "Really, you know,
we drank precious little, because it <i>is</i> such beastly stuff.
But I liked, we all liked, to believe that we were doing the
correct thing&mdash;eh? And it warmed us up. Just a taste
made the Caterpillar awfully funny."</p>

<p>"I see."</p>

<p>"Do you see? I doubt it, C&aelig;sar. Perhaps I shall<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span>
horrify you when I tell you that vice interests me. I used
to buy the <i>Police News</i> when I was a kid, and simply
wallow in it. I told a woman that last Easter, and she
laughed&mdash;she was as clever as they make 'em&mdash;and said
that I suffered from what the French call <i>la nostalgie de la
boue</i>; that means, you know, the homesickness for the
gutter. Rather personal, but dev'lish sharp, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"I think she was a beast."</p>

<p>"Not she, she's a sort of cousin; she came from the
same old place herself; that's why she understood. You
don't want to know what goes on in the slums, but I do.
Why? Because my grand-dad was born in 'em."</p>

<p>"He pulled himself out by brains and muscles."</p>

<p>"But he went back&mdash;sometimes. Oh yes, he did.
And the governor&mdash;I'm up to some of <i>his</i> little games. I
could tell you&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;shut up!" said C&aelig;sar, the colour flooding his cheeks.</p>

<p>Upon the last Saturday of the term the School Concert
took place. Few of the boys in the Manor, and none out
of it, knew that John Verney had been chosen to sing the
treble solo; always an attractive number of the programme.
John, indeed, was painfully shy in regard to his
singing, so shy that he never told Desmond that he had a
voice. And the music-master, enchanted by its quality,
impressed upon his pupil the expediency of silence. He
wished to surprise the School.</p>

<p>The concerts at Harrow take place in the great Speech-room.
Their characteristic note is the singing of Harrow
songs. To any boy with an ear for music and a heart
susceptible of emotion these songs must appeal profoundly,
because both words and music seem to enshrine all that
is noble and uplifting in life. And, sung by the whole
School (as are most of the choruses), their message becomes
curiously emphatic. The spirit of the Hill is acclaimed,
gladly, triumphantly, unmistakably, by Harrovians repeating
the creed of their fathers, knowing that creed will be
so repeated by their sons and sons' sons. Was it happy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
chance or a happier sagacity which decreed that certain
verses should be sung by the School "Twelve," who have
struggled through form after form and know (and have not
yet had time to forget) the difficulties and temptations
which beset all boys? They, to whom their fellows unanimously
accord respect at least, and often&mdash;as in the case
of a Captain of the Cricket Eleven&mdash;enthusiastic admiration
and fealty; these, the gods, in a word, deliver their injunction,
transmit, in turn, what has been transmitted to
them, and invite their successors to receive it. To many
how poignant must be the reflection that the trust they are
about to resign might have been better administered! But
to many there must come upon the wings of those mighty,
rushing choruses the assurance that the Power which has
upheld them in the past will continue to uphold them in
the future. In many&mdash;would one could say in all&mdash;is
quickened, for the first time, perhaps, a sense of what they
owe to the Hill, the overwhelming debt which never can
be discharged.</p>

<p>Desmond sat beside Scaife. Scaife boasted that he
could not tell "God save the Queen" from "The Dead
March in Saul." He confessed that the concert bored him.
Desmond, on the other hand, was always touched by music,
or, indeed, by anything appealing to an imagination which
gilded all things and persons. He was Scaife's friend, not
only (as John discovered) because Scaife had a will strong
enough to desire and secure that friendship, but because&mdash;a
subtler reason&mdash;he had never yet seen Scaife as he was,
but always as he might have been.</p>

<p>Desmond told Scaife that he could not understand why
John had bottled up the fact that he was chosen to sing
upon such an occasion. Scaife smiled contemptuously.</p>

<p>"You never bottle up anything, C&aelig;sar," said he.</p>

<p>"Why should I? And why should he?"</p>

<p>"I expect he'll make an awful ass of himself."</p>

<p>"Oh no, he won't," Desmond replied. "He's a clever
fellow is Jonathan."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span></p>

<p>As he gave John his nickname, Desmond's charming
voice softened. A boy of less quick perceptions than Scaife
would have divined that the speaker liked John, liked him,
perhaps, better than he knew. Scaife frowned.</p>

<p>"There are several Old Harrovians," he said, indicating
the seats reserved for them. "It's queer to me that they
come down for this caterwauling."</p>

<p>Desmond glanced at him sharply, with a wrinkle between
his eyebrows. For the moment he looked as if he were
short-sighted, as if he were trying to define an image somewhat
blurred, conscious that the image itself was clear
enough, that the fault lay in the obscurity of his own vision.</p>

<p>"They come down because they're keen," he replied.
"My governor can't leave his office, or he'd be here. I like
to see 'em, don't you, Demon?"</p>

<p>"I could worry along without 'em," the Demon replied,
half-smiling. "You see," he added, with the blend of
irony and pathos which always captivated his friend, "you
see, my dear old chap, I'm the first of my family at Harrow,
and the sight of all your brothers and uncles and fathers
makes me feel like Mark Twain's good man, rather
<i>lonesome</i>."</p>

<p>At once Desmond responded, clutching Scaife's arm.</p>

<p>"You're going to be Captain of the cricket and footer
Elevens, and School racquet-player, and a monitor; and
after you leave you'll come down here, and you'll see that
Harrow hasn't forgotten you, and then you'll know why
these fellows cut engagements. My governor says that an
hour at a School Concert is the finest tonic in the world for
an Old Harrovian."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up!" said Scaife; "you make me feel more
of an outsider than good old Snowball." He glanced at
a youth sitting close to them. Snowball was as black as
a coal: the son of the Sultan of the Sahara. "Yes,
C&aelig;sar, you can't get away from it, I <i>am</i> an 'alien.'"</p>

<p>"You're a silly old ass! I say, who's the guest of
honour?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>Next to the Head Master was sitting a thin man upon
whose face were fixed hundreds of eyes. The School had
not been told that a famous Field Marshal, the hero of a
hundred fights, was coming to the concert. And, indeed,
he had accepted an invitation given at the last moment&mdash;accepted
it, moreover, on the understanding that his visit
was to be informal. None the less, his face was familiar
to all readers of illustrated papers. And, suddenly, conviction
seized the boys that a conqueror was among them,
an Old Etonian, making, possibly, his first visit to the Hill.
Scaife whispered his name to Desmond.</p>

<p>"Why, of course," Desmond replied eagerly. "How
splendid!"</p>

<p>He leaned forward, devouring the hero with his eyes,
trying to pierce the bronzed skin, to read the record. From
his seat upon the stage John, also, stared at the illustrious
guest. John was frightfully nervous, but looking at the
veteran he forgot the fear of the recruit. Both Desmond
and he were wondering what "it felt like" to have done so
much. And&mdash;they compared notes afterwards&mdash;each boy
deplored the fact that the great man was not an Old
Harrovian. There he sat, cool, calm, slightly impassive.
John thought he must be rather tired, as a man ought to be
tired after a life of strenuous endeavour and achievement.
He had done&mdash;so John reflected&mdash;an awful lot. Even now,
he remained the active, untiring servant of Queen and
country. And he had taken time to come down to Harrow
to hear the boys sing. And, dash it all! he, John, was
going to sing to him.</p>

<p>At that moment Desmond was whispering to Scaife&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Demon; I'm jolly glad that I've not got to
sing before <i>him</i>. I bet Jonathan is in a funk."</p>

<p>"A big bit of luck," replied Scaife, reflectively. Then,
seeing the surprise on Desmond's face, he added, "If
Jonathan can sing&mdash;and I suppose he can, or he wouldn't
be chosen&mdash;this is a chance&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of what?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[98]</a></span></p>

<p>"C&aelig;sar, sometimes I think you've no brains. Why, a
chance of attracting the notice of a tremendous swell&mdash;a
man, they say, who never forgets&mdash;never! Jonathan may
want a commission in the Guards, as I do; and if he pleases
the great man, he may get it."</p>

<p>"Jonathan's not thinking of that," said Desmond.
"Shush-h-h!"</p>

<p>The singers stood up. They faced the Field Marshal,
and he faced them. He looked hardest at Lawrence,
pointed out to him by the Head Master. Perhaps he was
thinking of India; and the name of Lawrence indelibly
cut upon the memories of all who fought in the Mutiny.
And Lawrence, you may be sure, met his glance steadily,
being fortified by it. The good fellow felt terribly distressed,
because he was leaving the Hill; and, being a
humble gentleman, the old songs served to remind him,
not of what he had done, but of what he had left undone&mdash;the
words unspoken, the actions never now to be performed.
The chief caught his eye, smiled, and nodded, as if to say,
"I claim your father's son as a friend."</p>

<p>When the song came to an end, John was seized with
an almost irresistible impulse to bolt. His turn had come.
He must stand up to sing before nearly six hundred boys,
who would stare down with gravely critical and courteously
amused eyes. And already his legs trembled as if he were
seized of a palsy. John knew that he could sing. His
mother, who sang gloriously, had trained him. From her
he had inherited his vocal chords, and from her he drew
the knowledge how to use them.</p>

<p>When he stood up, pale and trembling, the silence fell
upon his sensibilities as if it were a dense, yellow fog. This
silence, as John knew, was an unwritten law. The small
boy selected to sing to the School, as the representative of
the School, must have every chance. Let his voice be
heard! The master playing the accompaniment paused
and glanced at his pupil. John, however, was not looking
at him; he was looking within at a John he despised&mdash;a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
poltroon, a deserter about to run from his first engagement.
He knew that the introduction to the song was being played
a second time, and he saw the Head Master whispering to
his guest. Paralysed with terror, John's intuition told
him that the Head Master was murmuring, "That's the
nephew of John Verney. Of course you know him?"
And the Field Marshal nodded. And then he looked at
John, as John had seen him look at Lawrence, with the
same flare of recognition in the steel-grey eyes. Out of the
confused welter of faces shone that pair of eyes&mdash;twin
beacons flashing their message of encouragement and
salvation to a fellow-creature in peril&mdash;at least, so John
interpreted that piercing glance. It seemed to say, far
plainer than words, "I have stood alone as you stand;
I have felt my knees as wax; I have wished to run away.
But&mdash;<i>I didn't</i>. Nor must you. Open your mouth and
sing!"</p>

<p>So John opened his mouth and sang. The first verse
of the lyric went haltingly.</p>

<p>Scaife growled to Desmond, "He <i>is</i> going to make an
ass of himself."</p>

<p>And Desmond, meeting Scaife's eyes, half thought that
the speaker wished that John would fail&mdash;that he grudged
him a triumph. None the less, the first verse, sung feebly,
with wrong phrasing and imperfect articulation, revealed
the quality of the boy's voice; and this quality Desmond
recognized, as he would have recognized a fine painting or
a bit of perfect porcelain. All his short life his father had
trained him to look for and acclaim quality, whether in
things animate or inanimate. He caught hold of Scaife's
arm.</p>

<p>"Make an ass of himself!" he whispered back. "Not
he. But he may make an ass of me."</p>

<p>Even as he spoke he was aware that tears were horribly
near his eyes. Some catch in John's voice, some subtle
inflection, had smitten his heart, even as the prophet smote
the rock.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rot!" said Scaife, angrily.</p>

<p>He was angry, furiously angry, because he saw that
C&aelig;sar was beyond his reach, whirled innumerable leagues
away by the sound of another's voice. John had begun
the second verse. He stared, as if hypnotized, straight into
the face of the great soldier, who in turn stared as steadily
at John; and John was singing like a lark, with a lark's
spontaneous delight in singing, with an ease and self-abandonment
which charmed eye almost as much as ear.
Higher and higher rose the clear, sexless notes, till two of
them met and mingled in a triumphant trill. To Desmond,
that trill was the answer to the quavering, troubled
cadences of the first verse; the vindication of the spirit
soaring upwards unfettered by the flesh&mdash;the pure spirit,
not released from the pitiful human clay without a fierce
struggle. At that moment Desmond loved the singer&mdash;the
singer who called to him out of heaven, who summoned
his friend to join him, to see what he saw&mdash;"the vision
splendid."</p>

<p>John began the third and last verse. The famous soldier
covered his face with his hand, releasing John's eyes, which
ascended, like his voice, till they met joyfully the eyes of
Desmond. At last he was singing to his friend&mdash;<i>and his
friend knew it</i>. John saw Desmond's radiant smile, and
across that ocean of faces he smiled back. Then, knowing
that he was nearer to his friend than he had ever been
before, he gathered together his energies for the last line of
the song&mdash;a line to be repeated three times, loudly at first,
then more softly, diminishing to the merest whisper of
sound, the voice celestial melting away in the ear of earth-bound
mortals. The master knew well the supreme difficulty
of producing properly this last attenuated note; but
he knew also that John's lungs were strong, that the vocal
chords had never been strained. Still, if the boy's breath
failed; if anything&mdash;a smile, a frown, a cough&mdash;distracted
his attention, the end would be&mdash;weakness, failure. He
wondered why John was staring so fixedly in one direction.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span></p>

<p>Now&mdash;now!</p>

<p>The piano crashed out the last line; but far above it,
dominating it, floated John's flute-like notes. The master
played the same bars for the second time. He was still
able to sustain, if it were necessary, a quavering, imperfect
phrase. But John delivered the second repetition without
a mistake, singing easily from the chest. The master put
his foot upon the soft pedal. Nobody was watching him.
Had any one done so, he would have seen the perspiration
break upon the musician's forehead. The piano purred its
accompaniment. Then, in the middle of the phrase, the
master lifted his hands and held them poised above the
instrument. John had to sing three notes unsupported.
He was smiling and staring at Desmond. The first note
came like a question from the heart of a child; the second,
higher up, might have been interpreted as an echo to the
innocent interrogation of the first, the head no wiser than
the heart; but the third and last note had nothing in it
of interrogation: it was an answer, all-satisfying&mdash;sublime.
Nor did it seem to come from John at all, but from above,
falling like a snowflake out of the sky.</p>

<p>And then, for one immeasurable moment&mdash;<i>silence</i>.</p>

<p>John slipped back to his seat, crimson with bashfulness,
while the School thundered applause. The Field Marshal
shouted "Encore," as loudly as any fag; but the Head
Master whispered&mdash;</p>

<p>"We don't encourage <i>encores</i>. A small boy's head is
easily turned."</p>

<p>"Not his," the hero replied.</p>

<p>Two numbers followed, and then the School stood up,
and with them all Old Harrovians, to sing the famous
National Anthem of Harrow, "Forty Years on." Only
the guests and the masters remained seated.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 23em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Forty years on, growing older and older,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Shorter in wind, as in memory long,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Feeble of foot and rheumatic of shoulder,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What will it help you that once you were strong?<br /></span><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>

<span class="i2">With the tramp of the twenty-two men.<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Follow&mdash;up!"<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>As the hundreds of voices, past and present indissolubly
linked together, imposed the mandate, "<i>Follow up!</i>" the
Head Master glanced at his guest, but left unsaid the words
about to be uttered. Tears were trickling down the cheeks
of the man who, forty years before, had won his Sovereign's
Cross&mdash;For Valour.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After the concert, but before he left the Speech-room,
the Field Marshal asked the Head Master to introduce
Lawrence and John, and, of course, the Head of the School.
When John came up, there was a twinkle in the veteran's
eye.</p>

<p>"Ha&mdash;ha!" said he; "you were in a precious funk,
John Verney."</p>

<p>"I was, sir," said John.</p>

<p>"Gad! Don't I know the feeling? Well, well," he
chuckled, smiling at John, "you climbed up higher than
I've ever been in my life. What was it&mdash;hey? 'F' in 'alt'?"</p>

<p>"'G,' sir."</p>

<p>"You sang delightfully. Tell your uncle to bring you
to see me next time you are in town. You must consider
me a friend," he chuckled again&mdash;"an old friend. And
look ye here," his pleasant voice sank to a whisper, "I
daren't tip these tremendous swells, but I feel that I can
take such a liberty with you. Shush-h-h! Good-bye."</p>

<p>John scurried away, bursting with pride, feeling to the
core the strong grip of the strong man, hearing the thrill of
his voice, the thrill which had vibrated in thousands of
soldier-hearts. Outside, Fluff was awaiting him.</p>

<p>"Oh, Jonathan, you can sing, and no mistake."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span></p>

<p>"Five&mdash;six&mdash;seven mistakes," John answered.</p>

<p>The boys laughed.</p>

<p>John told Fluff what the hero had said to him, and
showed the piece of gold.</p>

<p>"What ho! The Creameries! Come on, Esm&eacute;."</p>

<p>At the Creameries several boys congratulated John, and
the Caterpillar said&mdash;</p>

<p>"You astonished us, Jonathan; 'pon my soul you did.
Have a 'dringer' with me? And Fluff, too? By the
way, be sure to keep your hair clipped close. These singing
fellows with manes may be lions in their own estimation,
but the world looks upon 'em as asses."</p>

<p>"That's not bad for you, Caterpillar," said a boy in
the Fifth.</p>

<p>"Not my own," said the Caterpillar, solemnly&mdash;"my
father's. I take from him all the good things I can get
hold of."</p>

<p>John polished off his "dringer," listening to the chaff,
but his thoughts were with Desmond. He had an intuition
that Desmond would have something to say to him. As
soon as possible he returned to the Manor.</p>

<p>There he found his room empty. John shut the door
and sat down, looking about him half-absently. The
Duffer had not contributed much to the mural decoration,
saying, loftily, that he preferred bare walls to rubbishy
engravings and Japanese fans. But, with curious inconsistency
(for he was the least vain of mortals), he had bought
at a "leaving auction" a three-sided mirror&mdash;once the
property of a great buck in the Sixth. The Duffer had got
it cheap, but he never used it. The lower boys remarked
to each other that Duff didn't dare to look in it, because
what he would see must not only break his heart but
shatter the glass. Generally, it hung, folded up, close to
the window, and the Duffer said that it would come in
handy when he took to shaving.</p>

<p>John's eye rested on this mirror, vacantly at first, then
with gathering intensity. Presently he got up, crossed the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
room, opened the two folding panels, and examined himself
attentively, pursing up his lips and frowning. He
could see John Verney full face, three-quarter face, and half-face.
And he could see the back of his head, where an
obstinate lock of hair stuck out like a drake's tail. John
was so occupied in taking stock of his personal disadvantages
that a ringing laugh quite startled him.</p>

<p>"Why, Jonathan! Giving yourself a treat&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>John turned a solemn face to Desmond. "I think my
head is hideous," he said ruefully.</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"It's too long," John explained. "I like a nice round
head like yours, C&aelig;sar. I wish I wasn't so ugly."</p>

<p>Desmond laughed. John always amused him. C&aelig;sar
was easily amused, saw the funny side of things, and contrasts
tickled his fancy agreeably. But he stopped laughing
when he realized that John was hurt. Then, quickly,
impulsively, he said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Your head is all right, old Jonathan. And your voice
is simply beautiful." He spoke seriously, staring at John
as he had stared in the Speech-room when John began to
sing. "I came here to tell you that. I felt odd when you
were singing&mdash;quite weepsy, you know. You like me, old
Jonathan, don't you?"</p>

<p>"Awfully," said John.</p>

<p>"Why did you look at me when you sang that last
verse? Did you know that you were looking at me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You looked at me because&mdash;well, because&mdash;bar chaff&mdash;you&mdash;liked&mdash;me?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"You&mdash;you like me better than any other fellow in the
school?"</p>

<p>"Yes; better than any other fellow in the world."</p>

<p>"Is it possible?"</p>

<p>"I have always felt that way since&mdash;yes&mdash;since the very
first minute I saw you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span></p>

<p>"How rum! I've forgotten just where we did meet&mdash;for
the first time."</p>

<p>"I shall never forget," said John, in the same slow,
deliberate fashion, never taking his eyes from Desmond's
face. Ever since he had sung, he had known that this
moment was coming. "I shall never forget it," he repeated&mdash;"never.
You were standing near the Chapel.
I was poking about alone, trying to find the shop where we
buy our straws. And I was feeling as all new boys feel,
only more so, because I didn't know a soul."</p>

<p>"Yes," said Desmond, gravely; "you told me that.
I remember now; I mistook you for young Hardacre."</p>

<p>"You smiled at me, C&aelig;sar. It warmed me through and
through. I suppose that when a fellow is starving he never
forgets the first meal after it."</p>

<p>"I say. Go on; this is awfully interesting."</p>

<p>"I can remember what you wore. One of your bootlaces
had burst&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well; I'm&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I had a wild sort of wish to run off and buy you a
new lace&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Of all the rum starts I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Afterwards," John continued, "I tried to suck-up.
I asked you to come and have some 'food.' Do you
remember?"</p>

<p>"I'll bet I came, Jonathan."</p>

<p>"No; you didn't. You said 'No.'"</p>

<p>"Dash it all! I certainly said, 'No thanks.'"</p>

<p>"I dare say; but the 'No' hurt awfully because I did
feel that it was cheek asking you."</p>

<p>"Jonathan, you funny old buster, I'll never say 'No'
again. 'Pon my word, I won't. So I said 'No.' That's
odd, because it's not easy for me to say 'No.' The governor
pointed that out last hols. Somehow, I can't say 'No,'
particularly if there's any excitement in saying 'Yes.'
And my beastly 'No' hurt, did it? Well, I'm very, <i>very</i>
sorry."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span></p>

<p>He held out his hand, which John took. Then, for a
moment, there was a pause before Desmond continued
awkwardly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know, Jonathan, that the Demon is my pal.
You like him better than you did, don't you?"</p>

<p>John had the tact not to speak; but he shook his head
dolefully.</p>

<p>"And I couldn't chuck him, even if I wanted to, which
I don't&mdash;which I don't," he repeated, with an air of satisfying
himself rather than John. And John divined that
Scaife's hold upon Desmond's affections was not so strong
as he had deemed it to be. Desmond continued, "But
I want you, too, old Jonathan, and if&mdash;if&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"All right," said John, nobly. He perceived that
Desmond's loyalty to Scaife made him hesitate and flush.
"I understand, C&aelig;sar, and if I can't be first, let me be
second; only, remember, with me you're first, rain or
shine."</p>

<p>Desmond looked uneasy. "Isn't that a case of 'heads
I win, tails you lose'?"</p>

<p>John considered; then he smiled cheerfully, "You
know you are a winner, C&aelig;sar. You're cut out for a
winner; you can win whatever you want to win."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all rot," said Desmond. He looked very
grave, and in his eyes lay shadows which John had never
seen before.</p>

<p>And so ended John's first year at Harrow.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VII</h2>

<h3><i>Reform</i></h3>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 22em;"><p>"'It must be a gran' thing to be a colledge profissor.'</p>

<p>"'Not much to do,' said Mr. Hennessy.</p>

<p>"'But a gr&mdash;reat deal to say,' said Mr. Dooley."</p></div>


<p><span class="smcap">When John</span> returned to the Hill at the beginning of the
winter term the great change had taken place. Rutford
had assumed the duties of Professor of Greek at a Scotch
University; Warde was in possession of the Manor; Scaife
and Desmond and John&mdash;but not the Caterpillar&mdash;had got
their remove. They were Fifth Form boys&mdash;and in tails!
John, it is true, although tougher and broader, was still
short for his years and juvenile of appearance, but Scaife
and Desmond were quite big fellows, and their new coats
became them mightily. Trieve was Head of the House;
Lovell, Captain of the House football Eleven and in the
Lower Sixth.</p>

<p>"Lovell will have to behave himself now," the Duffer
remarked to Scaife, who laughed derisively, as he
answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"He couldn't, even if he tried."</p>

<p>Warde welcomed the House at lock-up, and introduced
the boys to his wife and daughter. Mrs. Warde had a
plain, pleasant face. Miss Warde, however, was a beauty,
and she knew it, the coquette, and had known it from the
hour she could peep into a mirror. The Caterpillar pronounced
her "fetching." Being only fifteen, she wore her
hair in a plait tied by a huge bow, and the hem of her skirt
barely touched the neatest ankle on Harrow Hill. Give
her a saucy, pink-and-white face, pop a pert, tip-tilted nose
into the middle of it just above a pouting red mouth, and
just below her father's lapis-lazuli eyes, and you will see<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
Iris Warde. Her hair was reddish, not red&mdash;call it warm
chestnut; and she had a dimple.</p>

<p>After the introductions, mother and daughter left the
hall. Warde stood up, inviting the House to sit down.
Warde was about half the width of the late Rutford, but
somehow he seemed to take up more room. He had spent
the summer holidays in Switzerland, climbing terrific peaks.
Snow and sun had coloured his clear complexion. John,
who saw beneath tanned skins, reflected that Warde seemed
to be saturated with fresh air and all the sweet, clean things
which one associates with mountains. "He loves hills,"
thought John, "and he loves our Hill." Warde began to
speak in his jerky, confidential tones. Dirty Dick had
always been insufferably dull, pompous, and didactic.</p>

<p>"I don't like speechmaking," said Warde, "but I
want to put one thing to you as strongly as a man may.
I have always wished to be master of the Manor. Some
men may think mine a small ambition. Master of a house
at Harrow? Nothing big about that. Perhaps not. But
I think it big. And it is big&mdash;for me. Understand that
I'm in love with my job&mdash;head over heels. I'd sooner be
master of the Manor than Prime Minister. I couldn't
tackle his work. Enough of that. Now, forget for a
moment that I'm a master. Let me talk as an Old Harrovian,
an old Manorite who remembers everything, ay&mdash;everything,
good and bad. Some lucky fellows remember
the good only; we call them optimists. Others remember
the bad. Pessimists those. Put me between the two. The
other day I had an eye, <i>one</i> eye, fixed on the top of a certain
peak&mdash;by Jove! how I longed to reach that peak!&mdash;but
the other eye was on a <i>crevasse</i> at my feet. Had I kept
both eyes on the peak, I should be lying now at the bottom
of that <i>crevasse</i>. You take me? Well, twenty years ago
I sat here, in hall, my last night in the old house, and I
hoped that one day I might come back. Why? This is
between ourselves, a confidence. I came to the Manor
from a beastly school, such schools are hardly to be found<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span>
nowadays&mdash;a hardened young sinner at thirteen. The
Manor licked me into shape. Speaking generally, I suppose
the tone of the house insensibly communicated itself
to me. The Manor was cock-house at games and work.
I began by shirking both. But the spirit of the Hill was
too much for me. I couldn't shirk that. Some jolly old
boys, we all know them and like them, are always saying
that their early school-days were the happiest of their lives.
They're fond of telling this big lie just as they're settling
down to their claret. I really believe that they believe
what they say, but it <i>is</i> a lie. The smallest boy here knows
it's a lie. Let's hark back a bit. I said I was licked into
shape&mdash;and I mean <i>licked</i>. I had a lot of really hard
fagging&mdash;much harder than any of you boys know&mdash;I was
sent up and swished, I had whoppings innumerable, and
it wasn't pleasant. My mother had pinched herself to
send me here, because my father had been here before me;
and I wondered why she did it. At that time I couldn't
see why cheaper schools shouldn't be not only as good as
Harrow, but perhaps better. Not till I was in the Fifth
did I get a glimmering of what my mother and the Manor
were doing for me. When I got into the Sixth and into
the Eleven, I knew. And my last year here made up, and
more, too, for the previous four. I enjoyed that year
thoroughly; I had ceased to be a slacker. I tell you, all
of you, that happiness, like liberty, must be earned before
we can enjoy it. And you are sent here to earn it. I'm
not going to keep you much longer. I have come to the
marrow of the matter. I owe the Manor a debt which I
hope to pay to&mdash;you. Just as you, in turn, will pay back
to boys not yet born the money your people have gladly
spent on you, and other greater things besides. I want to
see this house at the top of the tree again: cock-house at
cricket, cock-house at footer, with a Balliol Scholar in it,
and a school racquet-player. And now Dumbleton is
going to bring in a little champagne. We'll drink high
health and fellowship to the Manor and the Hill!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span></p>

<p>His face broke into the smile his form knew so well; he
sat down, as the house roared its welcome to a friend.</p>

<p>As soon as the champagne was drunk ("Dumber" was
careful to put more froth than wine into the glasses of the
kids), the boys filed out of the Hall. The Duffer, Desmond,
John, and the Caterpillar assembled in John's room.
Desmond, you may be sure, was afire with resolution.
Warde was the right sort, a clinker, a first flighter. And
he meant to stick by him through thick and thin. John
said nothing. The Caterpillar drawled out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Warde didn't surprise me&mdash;much. I've found out
that he's one of the Wardes of Warde-Pomeroy, the real
old stuff. Our families intermarried in Elizabeth's reign."</p>

<p>"Chance to do it again, Caterpillar," said the Duffer.
"Warde's daughter is an uncommonly pretty girl."</p>

<p>Then the Caterpillar used the epithet "fetching."</p>

<p>"She's fetching, very fetching," he said. "It's a
pleasure to remember that we're of kin. One must be
civil to Warde. He's a well bred 'un."</p>

<p>"You think too much of family," said Desmond.</p>

<p>"<i>One can't</i>," replied the Caterpillar, solemnly. "One
knows that family is not everything, but, other things
being equal, it means refinement. The first of the Howards
was a swineherd, I dare say, but generations of education,
of association with the best, have turned them from swine-herds
into gentlemen, and it takes generations to do it."</p>

<p>"Good old Caterpillar!" said the Duffer.</p>

<p>"Not my own," said the Caterpillar; adding, as usual,
"My governor's, you know."</p>

<p>"Warde hasn't a soft job ahead of him," said Desmond.</p>

<p>"Soft or hard, he'll handle it his own way."</p>

<p>Desmond went out, wondering what had become of
Scaife. Scaife was in his room, talking to Lovell senior,
who spent a fortnight with Scaife's people in Scotland,
fishing and grousing. Desmond had been asked also, but
his father, rather to C&aelig;sar's disgust (for the Scaife moor
was famous), had refused to let him go. Lovell and Scaife<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
were arguing about something which Desmond could not
understand.</p>

<p>"I left it to my partner," said Scaife, "and the fool
went no trumps holding two missing suits. The enemy
doubled, my partner redoubled, and the others redoubled
again: that made it ninety-six a trick. The fellow on the
left held my partner's missing suits; he made the Little
Slam, and scored nearly six hundred below the line. It
gave 'em the rubber, too, and I had to fork out a couple of
quid."</p>

<p>"What are you jawing about, Demon?" said Desmond.</p>

<p>"Bridge. It's the new game. It's going to be the
rage. Do you play bridge, C&aelig;sar?"</p>

<p>"No. I want to learn it."</p>

<p>"All right, I must teach you."</p>

<p>"We could get up a four in this house," said Lovell.
"We three and the Caterpillar. He plays, I know. The
Colonel is one of the cracks at the Turf. It would be an
awful lark. A mild gamble: small points&mdash;eh? A bob
a hundred. What do you say, C&aelig;sar?"</p>

<p>Desmond hesitated. Bridge had not yet reached its
delirious stage. But Desmond had seen it played, had
heard his father praise it as the most fascinating of card-games,
and had determined to learn it at the first convenient
opportunity. None the less Warde's words still
echoed in his ear.</p>

<p>"I think we ought to give Warde a chance," he said.</p>

<p>"You don't mean to say you were taken in by him?"
said Lovell, contemptuously.</p>

<p>Desmond burst into enthusiastic praise of Warde and
his methods. Lovell shrugged his shoulders and walked
out of the room, nodding to Scaife, but ignoring Desmond.</p>

<p>"You must go canny with Lovell," said Scaife. "He's
the fellow who ought to give you your 'fez' after the first
house-game."</p>

<p>"Never mind that. You won't play bridge, Demon,
will you?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span></p>

<p>"Why not?" said Scaife. "Where's the harm? Your
governor plays&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You're afraid of getting sacked?"</p>

<p>"I'm not."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll take that back. You're not a funk,
C&aelig;sar, but you're so easily humbugged. Warde caught
you with his 'pi jaw' and a glass of gooseberry."</p>

<p>"The champagne was all right, wasn't it?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! So you do mean to stand in with Warde
against Lovell and me? Thanks for being so candid.
Now I'll be candid with you. I like Lovell. There's no
nonsense about him. He don't put on frills because he's
in the Sixth, and he don't mean to take to their sneaking,
spying ways. He's just as anxious as Warde to see the
Manor cock-house at footer and cricket, and I'm as keen
as he is; but we stop there. The Balliol Scholarship may
go hang. And as for sympathy and fellowship and pulling
together between masters and boys, I never did believe in
it, and never shall. My hand is against the masters, so
long as they interfere with anything I want to do. I like
bridge, and I mean to play it. And I'll take jolly good care
that I'm not nailed. That's part of the fun, as the drinking
used to be. I chucked that because it wasn't good
enough; but bridge is ripping, and, take my word for it,
you'll be keener than I when you begin."</p>

<p>"Perhaps. But I'm not going to begin here."</p>

<p>"Right&mdash;oh!"</p>

<p>Scaife turned aside, whistling, but out of the corner of
his shrewd eye he marked the expression of Desmond's
face, the colour ebbing and flowing in the round, boyish
cheeks, the perplexity on the brow. Then he spoke in
a different voice.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, old chap. You've stuck to me through
thick and thin, and I'm grateful, really and truly. You're
right, and I'm wrong; I always am wrong. I was
looking forward to larks. If you count 'em purple<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
sins, I don't blame you for letting me go to the devil by
myself."</p>

<p>"I never said bridge was a purple sin."</p>

<p>"Warde thinks it is. If you're going to look at life
here with his eyes, you'll have to rename things. Babies
play Beggar my Neighbour for chocolates; why shouldn't
we play bridge for a bob a hundred? The game is splendid
for the brain; ten thousand times better than translating
Greek choruses."</p>

<p>"But it is&mdash;gambling, Demon; you can't get away
from that."</p>

<p>"Pooh! It's gambling if I bet you a 'dringer' that
you won't make ten runs in a house-match; it's gambling
if I raffle a picture and you take a sixpenny ticket. Are
you going to give up that sort of gambling?"</p>

<p>"No; but&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"What would Warde say to our co-operative system
of work&mdash;eh? You're not prepared to go the whole hog?
You want to pick and choose. Good! But give me the
same right, that's all. Play bridge with your old pals, or
don't play, just as you please."</p>

<p>No more was said. Scaife's manner rather than his
matter confounded the younger and less experienced boy.
Scaife, too, tackled problems which many men prefer to
leave alone. Here heredity cropped up. Scaife's sire and
grandsire were earning their bread before they were sixteen.
Of necessity they faced and overcame obstacles which the
ordinary Public School-boy never meets till he leaves the
University.</p>

<p>For some time after this bridge was not mentioned.
Lovell, acting, possibly, under advice from Scaife, treated
Desmond courteously, and gave him his "fez" after the
first house-game. Both boys now were members of the
Manor cricket and football Elevens, and, as such, persons
of distinction in their small world. Scaife, moreover, began
to play football with such extraordinary dash and brilliancy,
that it seemed to be quite on the cards that he might get<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
his School Flannels. This possibility, and the Greek in
the Fifth, absorbed his energies for the first six weeks of
the winter quarter. John had come back to Scaife's room
to prepare work. Desmond felt that Scaife had been
generous in proposing that John should join them, because
in many small ways it had become evident that the Demon
disliked John, although he still spoke of the tight place out
of which John had hauled him. Through Scaife John
received his "fez"; and when John wore it for the first
time, Scaife came up and said, smiling&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'm nearly even with you, Verney."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?" said John.</p>

<p>"You know well enough what I mean," said Scaife,
winking his eye maliciously.</p>

<p>John flushed, because in his heart he did know. But
when he told Egerton what Scaife had said, that experienced
man of the world turned up his nose.</p>

<p>"Just like him," he said. "He wants you to feel that
he has wiped out his debt."</p>

<p>"Do you think my 'fez' ought to have been given to
young Lovell?"</p>

<p>The Caterpillar, who played back for the Manor, considered
the question.</p>

<p>"I don't know," he said. "You are pretty nearly
equal; but it's a fact that the Demon turned the scale.
He pointed out to Lovell that if he gave a 'fez' to his
young brother, the house might accuse him of favouritism.
That did the trick."</p>

<p>This made John uneasy and unhappy for a week or
two; but the consciousness that another might be better
entitled to the coveted "fez" made him play up with such
energy that he succeeded in proving to all critics that he
had honestly earned what luck had bestowed on him.</p>

<p>During the last week of October, John began those long
walks with Desmond which, afterwards, he came to regard
as perhaps the most delightful hours spent at Harrow.
Scaife detested walking. He had his father's power of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
focusing attention and energy upon a single object. For
the moment he was mad about football. Talk about
books, scenery, people, bored him, and he said so with his
usual frankness and impatience of restraint. Desmond, on
the other hand, was also like his father, inasmuch as his
tastes were catholic. He was a bit of a naturalist, learned
in the lore of woods and fields, and he liked to talk about
books, and he liked to talk about his home. Simple John
would sooner hear C&aelig;sar talk than listen to the heavenly
choir. So it came to pass that once a week at least the boys
would stroll down the avenue at Orley Farm (where
Anthony Trollope's sad boyhood was passed), or take the
Northwick Walk, which winds through meadows to the
Bridge, or visit John Lyon's farm at Preston, or, getting
signed for Bill, attempt a longer ramble to Ruislip Reservoir,
or Oxhey Wood, or Headstone with its moated grange,
or Horsington Hill with its long-stretching view across the
Uxbridge plain.</p>

<p>Very soon it became the natural thing for C&aelig;sar to give
John a glimpse, at least, of whatever floated in and out of
his mind. John, being himself a creature of reserves, could
not quite understand this unlocking of doors, but he
appreciated his privileges. C&aelig;sar's ingenuousness, sympathy,
and impulsiveness, seemed the more enchanting
because John himself was of the look-before-you-leap,
think-before-you-speak, sort. One Sunday evening they
were hurrying back to Chapel, when they passed a woman
carrying a heavy child. The poor creature appeared to be
almost fainting with fatigue and possibly hunger. Her
pinched face, her bent figure, her thin garments, bespoke
a passionate protest against conditions which obviously
she was powerless to avert or control. The boys glanced
at her with pitying eyes as they passed. Then Desmond
said quickly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Jonathan, she looks as if she was going to fall
down."</p>

<p>John, seeing what was in his friend's mind, said<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[116]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"We must hurry up, or we shall miss Chapel."</p>

<p>They offered the woman sixpences, and blushes, because
through the tattered shawl might be seen a shrunken
bosom.</p>

<p>The woman stared, stammered, and burst into tears.</p>

<p>"We shall miss Chapel," John repeated.</p>

<p>"Hang Chapel," said Desmond.</p>

<p>He was looking at the child. When the woman took
the silver, she let the child slip to the ground, where it
lay inert.</p>

<p>"What's the matter with it?" said Desmond.</p>

<p>Half sobbing, the woman explained that the child had
sprained its ankle.</p>

<p>"I'm just about done," she gasped; "an' the sight
o' you two young gen'lemen runnin' up the 'ill finished me.
I ain't the leaky sort," she added fiercely, still gasping and
trembling.</p>

<p>Then she bent down and tried to lift the heavy child,
which moaned feebly.</p>

<p>"You run on, Jonathan," said Desmond.</p>

<p>"Why?"</p>

<p>"I'm going to carry this kid up the hill."</p>

<p>"I'll help."</p>

<p>"No&mdash;hook it, you ass."</p>

<p>"I won't hook it."</p>

<p>Between them they carried the child as far as the
Speech-room, where a policeman accepted a shilling, and
gave in return a positive assurance that he would see woman
and child to their destination. When the boys were alone,
John said&mdash;</p>

<p>"C&aelig;sar&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"What a fellow you are! I wouldn't have thought of
that. It was splendid."</p>

<p>"Oh, shut up." There was a slight pause; then C&aelig;sar
said defiantly, "I thought of carrying that kid; but I
wouldn't have done it, unless I'd known that every boy<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
was safe in Chapel. I couldn't have faced the chaff.
And&mdash;you could."</p>

<p>They were punished for cutting Chapel, because C&aelig;sar
refused to give the reason which would have saved them.</p>

<p>"I'd have told the truth," he admitted to John, "if
I could have shouldered that kid with the Manorites
looking on."</p>

<p>John agreed that this was an excellent and a C&aelig;sarean
(he coined the adjective on this occasion) reason.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Among the Fifth Form boys of the Manor was a big,
coarse-looking youth of the name of Beaumont-Greene.
Everybody called him Beaumont-Greene in full, because
upon his first appearance at Bill he had stopped the line of
boys by refusing to answer to the name of Greene.</p>

<p>"My name," said he, in a shrill pipe, "is Beaumont-Greene,
and we spell the Greene with a final 'e'."</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene was a type of boy, unhappily, too
common at all Public Schools. He had no feeling whatever
for Harrow, save that it was a place where it behoved a
boy to escape punishment if he could, and to run, hot foot,
towards anything which would yield pleasure to his body.
He was known to the Manorites as a funk at footer, and a
prodigious consumer of "food" at the Creameries. His
father, having accumulated a large fortune in manufacturing
what was advertised in most of the public prints as
the "Imperishable, Seamless, Whale-skin Boot," gave his
son plenty of money. As a Lower Boy, Beaumont-Greene
had but a sorry time of it. Somebody discovered that he
was what Gilbert once described as an "imperfect ablutioner."
The Caterpillar made a point of telling new boys
the nature of the punishment meted out to the unclean.
He had assisted at the "toshing" of Beaumont-Greene.</p>

<p>"A nasty job," the Caterpillar would remark, looking
at his own speckless finger-nails: "but it had to be done.
We took the Greene person" (the Caterpillar alone refused
to defame the fine name of Beaumont by linking it to<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
Greene) "and placed him naked in a large tosh. Into that
tosh the house was invited to pour any fluid that could be
spared. One forgets things; but, unless I'm mistaken, the
particular sheep-wash used was made up of lemonade,
syrups, ink&mdash;plenty of that&mdash;milk (I bought a quart myself),
tooth-powder, paraffin, and a cake of Sapolio&mdash;Monkey
Brand! We scrubbed the Yahoo thoroughly,
washed its teeth, ears, hair, and then we dried it. I don't
know who smeared marmalade on to the towel, but the
drying part was not very successful. Rather tough&mdash;eh?
Yes, very tough&mdash;on <i>us</i>, but effective. The Greene person
has toshed regularly ever since. At least, so I'm told;
I never go near him myself, and he's considerate enough
to keep out of my way."</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene had not, it is true, the appetite for
reckless breaking of the law which distinguished Lovell and
his particular pals; but Lovell's good qualities cancelled
to a certain extent what was vicious. A fine cricketer,
a plucky football-player, he might have proved a credit
to his house had a master other than Dirty Dick been
originally in command of it. Before he was out of the
Shell, he had declared war against Authority. Beaumont-Greene,
on the other hand, detested games, and sneered at
those who played them. Pulpy, pimply, gross in mind and
body, he stood for that heavy, amorphous resistance to
good, which is so difficult to overcome.</p>

<p>During the first half of the winter quarter, John saw
but little of Esm&eacute; Kinloch. It is one of the characteristics
of a Public School that the boys&mdash;as in the greater world
for which it is a preparation&mdash;are in layers. Some layers
overlap; others never touch. Fluff was a fag; his friend
John was in the Fifth Form, and a "fez." In a word, an
Atlantic rolled between them. John, however, would
often give Fluff a "con," and occasionally they would walk
together. Fluff was no longer the delicate, girlish child of
a year ago. He had bloomed into a very handsome boy,
attractive, like all the members of his mother's family,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span>
with engaging manners, and he had also shown signs of
developing into a cricketer. Fluff could paddle his own
canoe, provided, of course, that he kept out of the rapids.</p>

<p>But about the middle of the term John noticed that
Fluff was losing colour and spirits, the latter never very
exuberant. It was not in John's nature to ask questions
which he might answer for himself by taking pains to
do so. He watched Fluff closely. Then he demanded
bluntly&mdash;</p>

<p>"What's up?"</p>

<p>"Nothing."</p>

<p>"That's a cram," said John, severely. "I didn't
believe you'd tell me a cram, Esm&eacute;."</p>

<p>"You don't care tuppence whether I tell crams or not&mdash;<i>now</i>."</p>

<p>John weighed the "now" deliberately.</p>

<p>"That's another cram," he said slowly. "Has anybody
been rotting you?"</p>

<p>Silence. John repeated the question. Still silence.
Then John added&mdash;</p>

<p>"You know, Esm&eacute;, that I shall stick to you till I find
out what's up; so you may as well save time by telling me
at once."</p>

<p>"It's Beaumont-Greene," faltered Fluff.</p>

<p>"That fat beast! What's he done?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't done much&mdash;yet."</p>

<p>"Tell everything!"</p>

<p>"He came into my room one night and turned me up
in my bed. I woke, on my head, in the dark, half-smothered,
and couldn't think what had happened; it was
simply awful. Then I heard his beastly voice saying, 'If I
let you down, will you do what I ask you?' I'd have
promised anything to get out of that horrible, choking prison,
and now he threatens to turn me up every night, and I
dream of it&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Go on," said John, grimly. "No, you needn't go on.
I can guess what this low cad is up to."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span></p>

<p>"He said he'd be my friend; as if I'd have a beast like
that for a friend."</p>

<p>"Did you tell him that?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I did."</p>

<p>"You're a good-plucked 'un, Esm&eacute;. And he's made it
warm for you ever since?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But he hasn't turned you up again?"</p>

<p>"N-no; but he will. I'd almost sooner he'd do it, and
have done with it. I can't sleep."</p>

<p>"Now, don't be a silly fool," John commanded. "I'm
going to think this out, and I'll bet I make that fat, pimply
beast sit up and howl."</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully, John."</p>

<p>But the more John thought of what he had undertaken
to do, the less clearly he saw his way to do it. Evidently
Beaumont-Greene was too prudent to bully Fluff; he had
resorted to the crueller alternative of terrorizing him.
Lawrence would have settled this fellow's hash&mdash;so John
reflected&mdash;in a jiffy, but Trieve, "Miss Trieve," was hopelessly
incapable. Presently inspiration came. He seized
an opportunity when Beaumont-Greene happened to be
by himself; then he marched boldly into his room, leaving
the door ajar.</p>

<p>"Hullo! what do you want?"</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene was sitting opposite the fire, reading
a novel and leisurely consuming macaroons.</p>

<p>"I want you to leave young Kinloch alone&mdash;<i>please</i>."</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene nearly choked; then he spluttered
out&mdash;</p>

<p>"Say that again, will you?"</p>

<p>"I want you to leave young Kinloch alone."</p>

<p>"Really? Anything else?"</p>

<p>"Nothing more, thank you."</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene slowly raised himself out of his chair
and glared at John, whose head came to his chin.</p>

<p>"You've plenty of cheek."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>"What I have isn't spotty, anyway."</p>

<p>John saw the veins begin to swell in Beaumont-Greene's
throat. He thought with relief of the door ajar, but it
was part of his policy&mdash;a carefully devised policy&mdash;to provoke,
if possible, a scene. Then others would interfere,
explanations would be in order, and public opinion would
accomplish the rest.</p>

<p>"You infernal young jackanapes!"</p>

<p>"You pretty pet!"</p>

<p>"Get out of my room! Hook it!"</p>

<p>"I want to," said John, coolly enough, although his
heart was throbbing. "It's horribly fuggy in here, and
I've Jambi<a name="FNanchor_26_26" id="FNanchor_26_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_26" class="fnanchor">[26]</a> to do; but I'm not going till you give me
your word that you'll leave young Kinloch alone."</p>

<p>"If you don't walk out I'll chuck you out."</p>

<p>"You must catch me first," said John.</p>

<p>And then a very pretty chase took place. Beaumont-Greene,
fat, scant of breath, full of macaroons, began to
pursue John round and round the table. John skilfully
interposed chairs, sofa-cushions, anything he could lay
hands on. Passing the washstand, he secured an enormous
sponge, which an instant later flew souse into the face of
the grampus. An abridged edition of Liddell and Scott's
Greek Lexicon followed. This nearly brought the big
fellow to grass. In his rage he, too, began to hurl what
objects happened to be within reach, but he was a shocking
bad shot; he missed, or John dodged every time. John
did not miss. Finally, as John had foreseen, a couple of
Sixth Form fellows rushed in.</p>

<p>"What's the meaning of this infernal row?" asked one.</p>

<p>"Ask him," said John.</p>

<p>Authority stared at Beaumont-Greene, and then at his
wrecked room.</p>

<p>"I told him to hook it, and he wouldn't," spluttered
the gasping Greene.</p>

<p>"Why?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span></p>

<p>Half a dozen other fellows had come into the room.
Amongst them the Duffer and the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>"I wanted to hook it," John explained, "because it's
so beastly fuggy; but Beaumont-Greene wouldn't promise
me to do something he ought to do."</p>

<p>"This is mysterious."</p>

<p>"The swaggering young blackguard cheeked me,"
growled Greene.</p>

<p>"I was very polite&mdash;at first," pleaded John.</p>

<p>"Hook it now, anyway," said Authority.</p>

<p>"Not till he promises. If you turn me out, I'll come
back after you're gone."</p>

<p>"What is it you want him to promise?"</p>

<p>John had achieved his object.</p>

<p>"I want him to leave young Kinloch <i>alone</i>."</p>

<p>The two Sixth Form boys glanced at each other; at
John; at the gross, spotted face of Beaumont-Greene.
Then the senior said coldly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I suppose you have no objection, Beaumont-Greene,
to promising Verney or any one else that you will leave young
Kinloch alone?"</p>

<p>"I've never laid a finger on the kid," growled the big
fellow; but he looked pale and frightened.</p>

<p>"Then you promise&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"On your word of honour?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>That night John told Fluff with great glee how Beaumont-Greene
had been made to "sit up and howl."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER VIII</h2>

<h3><i>Verney Boscobel</i></h3>

<p class="block1">"In honour of all who believe that life was made for friendship."</p>


<p><span class="smcap">The immediate</span> result of the incident described in the last
chapter was to strengthen the bond between John and
Desmond. Desmond had the epic from Fluff, from the
Caterpillar, and finally from John himself.</p>

<p>"You bearded that poisonous beast in his den," exclaimed
he; "you plotted and planned for the scrimmage;
you foresaw what would happen. Well, you are a corker,
Jonathan."</p>

<p>"You'd have thought of something much better."</p>

<p>"Not I," Desmond replied.</p>

<p>Scaife, however, made no remarks. Possibly, because
Desmond made too many, singing John's praises behind
his back and to his face, in and out of season. This, of
course, was indiscreet, and led to hard words and harder
feelings. Beaumont-Greene realized that John had tarred
and feathered him. The fags, you may be sure, rubbed
the tar in. If Beaumont-Greene threatened to kick an
impudent Fourth Form boy, that youngster would bid him
be careful.</p>

<p>"If you don't behave yourself," he would say, "I shall
have to send Verney to your room."</p>

<p>Lovell senior remarked that Beaumont-Greene was a
"swine," but that Verney had put on "lift" and must be
snubbed. What? A boy who had not been two years in
the school <i>dared</i> to take the law into his own hands! The
matter ought to have been laid before the Head of the
House.</p>

<p>Accordingly, John found himself, much to his dismay,
unpopular with the Olympians. The last month of this<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span>
term was, in some ways, the most disagreeable he had yet
spent at Harrow.</p>

<p>But the gain of Desmond's friendship far outweighed the
loss of popularity. John tingled with pleasure when he
reflected that he had achieved his ambition to stand
between Scaife and Desmond. At the same time, he was
uncomfortably aware that Scaife seemed to have climbed
high above Desmond, who had stood still. In moments
of depression John told himself that he was a makeshift,
that Desmond would leave him and join the Demon whenever
that splendid young person chose to whistle him up.
Scaife had failed to get his Football Flannels, but he came
so near to beating all previous records that the School
began to regard him as a "Blood." He was seen arm-in-arm
with Lovell, strolling up and down the High Street,
and the fags breathlessly repeated what Desmond had
predicted a year ago: the Demon was the coming man.
And always, when John and Desmond passed him, John
thought he could read a derisive triumph upon the Demon's
handsome face, an expression which said plainly: "You
young fool, don't you know that I'm playing cat and
mouse with <i>you</i>?"</p>

<p>The three still met twice daily to prepare work. But
the moment that was done, Scaife disappeared, leaving
John and Desmond together.</p>

<p>"He's playing bridge in Lovell's room," said Desmond.</p>

<p>More facts were gleaned from the Caterpillar, who had
joined the bridge-players, but played seldom.</p>

<p>"One draws the line," said he, "at playing for stakes
one can't afford to lose. Lovell and the Demon have
made it too hot."</p>

<p>"And Warde will make it hotter," said John.</p>

<p>"Not he," replied the Caterpillar. "The Demon is a
wonder. Thanks to his brains, detection is impossible.
He suggested that Lovell's room should be used. Warde
wouldn't dare to burst in upon one of the Sixth. And you
ought to see their dodgy arrangements. Lovell has his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
young brother on guard. I'm hanged if the Demon didn't
invent a sort of drill, which they go through with a stop-watch.
It's a star performance, I tell you. Young Lovell
bolts in. In thirty-five seconds&mdash;they have got it down
to that&mdash;the cards and markers are hidden; and the four
of 'em are jawing away about footer."</p>

<p>"All the same," said John, obstinately, "Warde will
be too much for 'em."</p>

<p>"Oh, rot!" said the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>The Manor got into the semi-finals of the football
matches, and when the School broke up for the Christmas
holidays it was generally conceded that the fortunes of the
ancient house were mending. In the Manor itself Warde's
influence was hardly yet perceptible: only a very few
knew that it was diffusing itself, percolating into nooks and
crevices undreamed of: the hearts of the Fourth Form, for
instance. In Dirty Dick's time there had been almost
universal slackness. In pupil-room Rutford read a book;
boys could work or not as they pleased, provided their
tutor was not disturbed. Warde, on the other hand, made
it a point of honour to work with his pupils. His indefatigable
energies, his good humour, his patience, were
never so conspicuous as when he was coaching duffers. In
other ways he made the boys realize that he was at the
Manor for their advantage, not his own. The gardens and
park were kept strictly private by Dirty Dick. Warde
threw them open: a favour hardly appreciated in the
whiter quarter, but the House admitted that it would be
awfully jolly in the summer to lie under the trees far from
the "crowd." In a word&mdash;a "privilege."</p>

<p>Upon the last Saturday, to John's delight, Desmond
asked him to spend a week in Eaton Square. John had
paid two visits to White Ladies; he was now about to
experience something entirely new. White Ladies and
Verney Boscobel were typical of the past; they illustrated
the history of the families who had inhabited them. The
great world went to White Ladies to see the pictures and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
the gardens, the Gobelin tapestries, the Duchess and her
guests; but the same world dined in Eaton Square to see
Charles Desmond.</p>

<p>During this visit, our John first learned what miracles
one individual may accomplish. At White Ladies, he had
dimly perceived, as has been said, the duties and responsibilities
imposed upon rank and wealth. In Eaton Square
he saw more plainly the duties and responsibilities imposed
upon a man of great talents. Both Charles Desmond and
the Duke of Trent were hard workers, but the labours of
the duke seemed to John (and to other wise persons)
drab-coloured. Charles Desmond's work, in contrast,
presented all the colours of the spectrum. John left White
Ladies, thanking his stars that he was not a duke; he came
away from Eaton Square filled with the ambition to be
Private Secretary to the great Minister. And when Mr.
Desmond said to him with his genial smile, "Well, young
John, Harry, I hope, will be my secretary, and the crutch
of my declining years. But what would you like to be?"
John replied fervently, "Oh, sir, I should like to be Harry's
understudy."</p>

<p>"Would you?"</p>

<p>And then John saw the face of his kind host change.
The smile faded. Mr. Desmond had taken his answer as
John meant it to be taken&mdash;seriously. He examined John
as if he were already a candidate for office. The piercing
eyes probed deep. Then he said slowly, "I should like
to have you under me, John. We shall talk of this again,
my boy. My own sons&mdash;&mdash;" He paused, sighed, and
then laughed, tapping John's cheek with his slender,
finely-formed fingers. But he passed on without finishing
his sentence. John knew that, of C&aelig;sar's brothers, Hugo,
the eldest, was Secretary of Legation at Teheran; Bill
"devilled" for a famous barrister; Lionel wore her
Majesty's livery. Strange that none had elected to serve
his own father! C&aelig;sar explained later.</p>

<p>"You see," he said, "the dear old governor outshines<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
everybody. Hugo and the others felt that under him they
would be in eclipse, for ever and ever&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"I see," said John, gravely. "Yes, there's something
in that. He wants you, C&aelig;sar."</p>

<p>"Dear old governor!" the other replied. "Yes&mdash;he's
keen on that. But I hope to make my own little mark.
I'd like to have my name on a brass tablet in Harrow
Chapel; that would be something." His eyes began to
glow and sparkle.</p>

<p>Next day, at dinner, Rodney's name cropped up.</p>

<p>"Rodney paved the way for Nelson," Mr. Desmond
observed. "I look upon him as one of our greatest
Harrovians. We ought to have a building to Rodney's
memory. I put him before Peel or Byron."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, father&mdash;&mdash;" Hot protest from C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>"Act before word, Harry; practice before precept.
Rodney was a man of action. I should like to have been
Rodney."</p>

<p>"I should like to have been Sheridan," said C&aelig;sar.
"I often look at his name on the third panel of the Fourth
Form Room."</p>

<p>He glanced at his father, who smiled, knowing that a
delicate compliment was intended, for enthusiastic admirers
had spoken of Charles Desmond as the Richard Brinsley
Sheridan of the modern House of Commons. The father
said curtly&mdash;</p>

<p>"A sky-rocket, my dear Harry." Then he turned to
John. "And of all our famous Harrovians whom would
you like to take as a pattern, young John?"</p>

<p>John hesitated. Two or three of the guests present
were celebrities. Amongst them was England's greatest
critic sitting beside an ambassador. There happened to
be a lull in the talk. All looked curiously at John.</p>

<p>"I'd like to be another Lord Shaftesbury," he said
slowly.</p>

<p>"Good! Capital!" Mr. Desmond nodded his head.
"I knew him well." He poured out anecdote after<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
anecdote illustrating the character and temperament of
the statesman-philanthropist: his self-sacrifice, his devotion
to an ideal, his curious exclusiveness, his refinement, his
faith in an aristocracy never diminished by the indefatigable
zeal wherein he laboured to better the condition
of the poor. "If every rich man were animated by
Shaftesbury's spirit," said Mr. Desmond, in conclusion,
"extreme poverty would be wiped out of England, and yet
we should retain all that makes life charming and profitable.
He was no leveller, save of foul rookeries. First and
last he believed in order, particularly his own&mdash;a true
nobleman. And the inspiration of his great career came
to him on the Hill."</p>

<p>"Indeed?" said the Critic.</p>

<p>"John Verney will tell you all about it," said Mr.
Desmond, glancing cheerily at our hero. His was ever the
habit to draw out the humblest of his guests.</p>

<p>So John recited how young Anthony Ashley, standing
on the Hill, just below the churchyard, chanced to see a
pauper's coffin fall to the ground and burst open, revealing
the pitiful corpse within, and how he had exclaimed in
horror, "Good heavens! Can this be permitted simply
because the man was poor and friendless?" And how,
then and there, the boy had sworn to devote his powers
to the amelioration of poverty-stricken lives.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Mr. Desmond. "He told me that the
next fifteen minutes decided his career. Ah, he succeeded
greatly. Why, when I was at Harrow we used to cross
from Waterloo to Euston through some of the worst slums
in the world. You boys can't realize what they looked
like. And Shaftesbury's work and example wiped them
out of our civilization."<a name="FNanchor_27_27" id="FNanchor_27_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_27" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p>
<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span></p>
<p>When John returned to his uncle's house of Verney
Boscobel (his home since his father's death), C&aelig;sar Desmond
accompanied him. Then it seemed to John that his cup
brimmed, that everything he desired had been granted unto
him. Verney Boscobel stood in the heart of the great
forest, one of the few large manors within that splendid
demesne. The boys arrived at Lyndhurst Road Station
late in the evening, long after dusk, and were driven in
darkness through Bartley and Minstead up to the high-lying
moors of Stoneycross. Next morning, early, John
woke his friend, and opened the shutters.</p>

<p>"Jolly morning," he said. "Have a look at the Forest,
old chap."</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar jumped out of bed, and drew a long breath.</p>

<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed; "it's fairyland."</p>

<p>Frost had silvered all things below. Above, motionless
upon the blue heavens, as if still frozen by the icy fingers
of a December night, were some aerial transparencies of
aqueous vapour, amethystine in colour, with edges of
white foam. In the east, obscured, but not concealed, by
grey mist, hung the crimson orb of the sun. From it faint
rays shot forth, touching the clouds beneath, which, roused,
so to speak, out of sleep, drifted lethargically in a southerly
direction.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i2">"Underneath the young grey dawn<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A multitude of dense, white, fleecy clouds<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Were wandering in thick flocks, ...<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Shepherded by the slow, unwilling wind."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Desmond drew in his breath, sighing with purest delight.
From the lawns encompassing the house his eyes strayed
into a glade of bracken, gold gleaming through silver&mdash;a
glade shadowed by noble oaks and beeches, with one
birch tree in the middle of it surpassingly graceful. Upon
this each delicate bough and spray were outlined sharply
against the sky. Beyond the glade stretched the moor,
rugged, bleak, and treeless, sloping sharply upward.
Beyond the moor lay the Forest&mdash;belts of firs darkly purple;<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
and flanking these the irregular masses of oaks and beeches,
varying in tint from palest lavender to rose and brown,
some still in shadow, some in ever-increasing glow of sunlight;
not one the same and each in itself containing a
thousand differing forms, yet all harmonious parts of the
resplendent whole.</p>

<p>"I'm so glad you like my home," said John. "Shall we
have a gallop before breakfast? It's only a white frost."</p>

<p>So they galloped away into fairyland, returning with
mortal appetites to the oak-panelled dining-hall, whence a
Verney had ridden forth to join his kinsman, Sir Edmund,
in arms for the King upon the distant field of Edge Hill.
After breakfast the boys explored the quaint old house;
and John showed C&aelig;sar the twenty-bore gun, and promised
his guest much rabbit-shooting, and two days' hunting, at
least, with the New Forest Hounds, and some pike-fishing,
and possibly an encounter with a big grayling&mdash;which,
later, the boys saw walloping about in the Test above
Broadlands&mdash;a splendid fish, once hooked by John, and
lost&mdash;a three-pounder, of course.</p>

<p>O golden age! You will never forget that Christmas&mdash;will
you, John? If you live to be Prime Minister of
England, the memory of those first days alone with your
friend will remain green when the colour has been sucked
by Time out of everything else. Fifty years hence, maybe,
you will see C&aelig;sar's curly head and his blue eyes full of fun
and life, and you will hear his joyous laughter&mdash;peal upon
peal&mdash;echoing through the corridors of Verney Boscobel.
Your mother took him to her heart&mdash;didn't she? And all
the servants, from butler to scullery maid, voted him the
jolliest, cheeriest boy that ever came to Hampshire. Why,
Mrs. Osman, the cook, with a temper like tinder from too
much heat, refused flatly to let C&aelig;sar make toffee in her
kitchen. But just then a barrel-organ turned up, and before
she could open her mouth, C&aelig;sar was dancing a polka
with her; and after that he could make toffee, or hay, or
anything else, wherever and whenever he pleased.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span></p>

<p>When they returned to the Manor, John hoped and
prayed that this blessed intimacy would continue. It did&mdash;for
a time. The three boys got their remove, and found
themselves in the Second Fifth, where they proposed to
linger till after the summer term. Lovell and Scaife seemed
inseparable, and bridge began again, apparently an inexhaustible
source of amusement and excitement. Then
came the Torpid matches; and John, as Lawrence predicted,
was captain of the cock-house Eleven&mdash;the first
great victory of the Manorites. During the term, Scaife
and Desmond won no races, being in age betwixt and
between winners of Upper and Lower School races. Scaife
refused to train. Desmond took a few runs, but abandoned
them for racquets, the chief game in the Easter term, but
only played regularly by boys whose purses are well lined.
John confined his attention to "Squash." C&aelig;sar played
"Harder" with the Demon. The three worked together
as of yore. John now perceived that Scaife had joined a
clique pledged to fight Reform. It was in the air that
something might happen. Warde eyed the big fellows
shrewdly, as if measuring weapons. He confounded some
by asking them to dine with him. At dessert he would
talk of sport, or games, or politics&mdash;everything, in fine,
except "shop." The more worthy came away from these
pleasant evenings with rather a hangdog expression, as if
they had been receiving goods under false pretences. John
and Desmond were made especially welcome. And, after
dinner, John, whose voice had not yet cracked, would sing,
to Mrs. Warde's accompaniment, such songs as "O Bay of
Dublin, my heart yu're throublin'," or "Think of me
sometimes," or Handel's "Where'er you walk." The
Caterpillar made no secret of a passion for Iris Warde, and
became a dangerous rival of one of the younger masters.
He talked to Warde about genealogies and hunting, topics
of conversation in which they had a common interest outside
Harrow. John guessed that Warde was making an
effort to secure Egerton, who, for his part, took the world<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
as he found it, consorting alike with John and his friends,
and also with Lovell and Co. From the Caterpillar John
learned that Beaumont-Greene had begun to play bridge.</p>

<p>"Scaife and Lovell are skinning the beast," he added
confidentially. "Green he is, and no error."</p>

<p>"Ructions soon," said John.</p>

<p>"I don't believe it," replied the Caterpillar. "Take
my word, Warde knows what he's about. He's playing up
to the younger members of the house&mdash;you, C&aelig;sar, and
you, Jonathan&mdash;and he's letting the others slide."</p>

<p>"Giving 'em rope," said John, "to hang 'emselves."</p>

<p>"Well, now, there's something in that. That hadn't
occurred to me. What? You think that he's eggin' 'em
on, eh? Eggin' 'em on!"</p>

<p>"I think that, if I were you, Caterpillar, I'd cut loose
from that gang."</p>

<p>"They've made it rather warm for you."</p>

<p>"I don't care a hang about that."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, John's life had been made very
unpleasant by the fast set. Upon the other hand, the
Duffer, Fluff, and many Lower School boys reckoned him
their leader and adviser. And&mdash;such is the irony of Fate&mdash;John's
popularity with friends caused him more anxiety
than unpopularity with enemies. Towards the end of the
term, Desmond spoke of applying to Warde for a certain
room to be shared by himself and John. John had to
decline an arrangement desired passionately, because he
had indiscreetly promised not to chuck the Duffer. C&aelig;sar
dropped the subject. After this, John noticed a slight
coldness. He wondered whether C&aelig;sar were jealous,
jealousy being John's own besetting sin. Finally, he came
to the conclusion that his friend might be not jealous but
unreasonable. In any case, during the last three weeks of
the term, John saw less of C&aelig;sar, and more&mdash;more, indeed,
than he wanted&mdash;of the Duffer and Fluff.</p>

<p>And then came the paralysing news that Desmond had
promised to spend ten days with Scaife's people, that a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span>
Professional had been hired, and that both boys were
going to give their undivided energies to cricket.</p>

<p>Afterwards, John often wondered whether Scaife, with
truly demoniac insight into Desmond's character, had let
him go, so as to seize him with more tenacious grasp when
an opportunity presented itself.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>As soon as John saw C&aelig;sar after the Easter holidays,
he knew that, temporarily, at any rate, he had lost his
friend. C&aelig;sar, indeed, was demonstratively glad to see
him, and dragged him off next day to walk to a certain
bridge where a few short weeks before the boys had carved
their names upon the wooden railing, surrounding them
with a circle and the Crossed Arrows. But C&aelig;sar could
talk of nothing else but Scaife and cricket. They had both
"come on" tremendously. Scaife's people had a splendid
cricket-ground.</p>

<p>Poor John! If he could have submerged the Scaife
cricket-ground and the Scaife family by nodding his head,
I fear that he would have nodded it, although he told himself
that he was an ungenerous beast and cad not to
sympathize with his pal.</p>

<p>And before the boys got back to the Manor, C&aelig;sar said,
not without a blush, that he had learned to play bridge.</p>

<p>"I shall teach you, Jonathan."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"You're not going to play with Lovell and that beast
Beaumont-Greene?"</p>

<p>"The Demon says no cards this term, when lock-up's
late. And look here, Jonathan, I've made the Demon
promise to make the peace between Lovell and you.
You'll play for the House, of course, and we must all pull
together, as Warde says."</p>

<p>John might have smiled at this opportune mention of
Warde, but sense of humour was swamped in apprehension.
Desmond went on to talk about Scaife.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[134]</a></span></p>

<p>"He'll make 'em sit up, you see! The 'pro.' we had
is the finest cover-point in England. I never saw such a
chap. He dashes at the ball. Hit it as hard as you please,
he runs in, picks it up, and snaps it back to the wicket-keeper
as easy as if he was playing pitch and toss. And, by
Jove! the Demon can do it. You wait. I never saw any
fellow like him. He's only just sixteen, and he'll get his
Flannels. You needn't shake your old head, I know he will.
And we must work like blazes to get ours next summer."</p>

<p>John discounted much of this talk, but he soon found
out that C&aelig;sar had not overestimated the Demon's activity.
The draw at Lord's in the previous summer had been
attributed, by such experts as Webbe and Hornby, to bad
fielding. The Demon told John, with his hateful, derisive
smile, that he had remembered this when he selected a
"pro." Not for the first time, John realized Scaife's overpowering
ability to achieve his own ends. Who, but
Scaife, would have made fielding the principal object of
his holiday practice?</p>

<p>Within a fortnight, Scaife was put into the Sixth Form
game. Desmond found himself&mdash;thanks to Scaife&mdash;playing
in the First Fifth game; but John was placed in Second
Fifth Beta. Fortunately, he found an ally in Warde, who
had a private pitch in the small park surrounding the
Manor, where he coached the weaker players of his House.
John told himself that he ought to get his "cap"; but, as
the weeks slipped by, despite several creditable performances,
he became aware that the "cap" was withheld,
although it had been given to Fluff. There were five
vacancies in the House Eleven, but, according to precedent,
these need not be filled up till after the last House-match,
and possibly not even then. In a word, John might play
for the House, and even distinguish himself, without
receiving the coveted distinction. How sore John felt!</p>

<p>About the end of May he noticed that something was
amiss with C&aelig;sar. Generally they walked together on
Sunday, but not always. During these walks, as has been<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
said, C&aelig;sar did most of the talking. Now, of a sudden, he
became a half-hearted listener, and to John's repeated
question, "What's up?" he would reply irritably, "Oh,
don't bother&mdash;nothing."</p>

<p>Finally, John heard from the Caterpillar that C&aelig;sar
was playing bridge, and losing.</p>

<p>"They don't play often," the Caterpillar added; "but
on wet afternoons they make up for lost time. C&aelig;sar is
outclassed. I've told him, but he's mad keen about the
game."</p>

<p>Later, John learned from the same source that Sunday
afternoon was a bridge-fixture with Lovell and Co. At any
rate, C&aelig;sar did not play on Sunday. That was something.</p>

<p>Upon the following Saturday, after making an honest
fifteen runs and taking three wickets in a closely-contested
game, John was running into the Yard just before six Bill,
when Lovell stopped him.</p>

<p>"You can get your 'cap,'" he said coldly.</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks; thanks awfully!"</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar received this agreeable news with indifference.</p>

<p>"You ought to have had it before Fluff," he growled.</p>

<p>"To-morrow, we'll walk to John Lyon's farm," said
John, eagerly.</p>

<p>"Engaged," C&aelig;sar replied.</p>

<p>"Oh, C&aelig;sar, you're&mdash;you're&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Well?"</p>

<p>"You're going to play bridge?"</p>

<p>"Yes. What of it? It's only once in a way. I <i>do</i>
bar cards on Sunday; but there are reasons."</p>

<p>"What reasons?"</p>

<p>"Reasons which&mdash;er&mdash;I'll keep to myself."</p>

<p>"All right," said John, stiffly, but with a breaking
heart.</p>

<p>Next day he asked Fluff to walk with him, but Fluff
was walking with some one else. The Duffer had letters
to write, and stigmatized walking as a beastly grind. John<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
determined to walk by himself; but as he was leaving the
Manor he met the Caterpillar, a tremendous buck, arrayed
in his best&mdash;patent-leather boots, white waistcoat, a flower
in his buttonhole.</p>

<p>"Where are you off to, Jonathan?"</p>

<p>"To Preston. You'd better come, Caterpillar."</p>

<p>"I never walk far in these boots. Peal made 'em."</p>

<p>"Change 'em, can't you?"</p>

<p>"Right."</p>

<p>While he was absent, John seriously considered the
propriety of taking Egerton into his confidence. Sincerely
attached to Egerton, and valuing his advice, he knew, none
the less, that the Caterpillar looked at everybody and everything
with the eyes of a colonel in the Guards. To tell
Colonel Egerton's son that one's heart was lacerated because
C&aelig;sar Desmond was playing bridge on Sunday seemed to
invite jeers. And, besides, that wasn't the real reason.
John felt wretched because the Sunday walk had been
sacrificed to Moloch. Presently Egerton came downstairs,
spick and span, but not quite so smart. The boys walked
quickly, talking of cricket.</p>

<p>"The Demon'll get his Flannels," said Egerton. "I'm
glad Lovell gave you your cap, Jonathan; you deserved it
a month ago. It wasn't my fault you didn't get it at the
beginning of the term."</p>

<p>"I'm sure of that," said John, gratefully.</p>

<p>"You don't look particularly bucked-up. A grin improves
your face, my dear fellow."</p>

<p>At this John burst into explosive speech. Those beasts
had got hold of C&aelig;sar. The Caterpillar stared; he had
never heard John let himself go. John's vocabulary
surprised him.</p>

<p>"Whew-w-w!" he whistled. "Gad! Jonathan, you do
pile on the agony. C&aelig;sar's all right. Don't worry."</p>

<p>"He's not all right. I thought C&aelig;sar had backbone,
I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Hold on," said the Caterpillar, gravely.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>John thought he was about to be rebuked for disloyalty
to a pal, an abominable sin in the Caterpillar's eyes.</p>

<p>"Well?" said John.</p>

<p>"I'm going to tell you something," said Egerton.
"But you must swear not to give me away."</p>

<p>"I'll swear."</p>

<p>"You're a good little cove, Jonathan, but sometimes
you smell just a little bit of&mdash;er&mdash;bread and butter. Keep
cool. Personally, I would sooner that you, at your age,
did smell of bread and butter than whisky. Well, you
think that C&aelig;sar is going straight to the bow-wows because
he plays bridge. You accuse him in your own little mind
of feebleness, and so forth. Yes, just so. And it's doosid
unfair to C&aelig;sar, because he's given up his walk to-day
entirely on your account. Ah! I thought that would
make you sit up."</p>

<p>"My account?" John repeated blankly.</p>

<p>"Yes; C&aelig;sar would be furious if he knew that I was
peaching, but he won't know, and instead of this&mdash;er&mdash;trifling
affair weakening your good opinion of your pal, it
will strengthen it."</p>

<p>"Oh, do go on, Caterpillar."</p>

<p>"Yesterday I was in Lovell's room. We were talking
of the first House match. Scaife and C&aelig;sar were there. I
took it upon myself to say you ought to be given your
'cap'; and then C&aelig;sar burst out, 'Oh yes, Lovell, do give
him his "cap." If you knew how he'd slaved to earn it.'
But Lovell only laughed. And then Scaife chipped in,
'Look here, C&aelig;sar,' he said, 'do I understand that you put
this thing, which after all is none of your business or mine,
as a favour which Lovell might do <i>you</i>?' And C&aelig;sar
answered, 'You can put it that way, if you like, Demon.'
And then Scaife laughed. I don't like Scaife's laugh,
Jonathan."</p>

<p>"I loathe it," said John.</p>

<p>"Well, when Scaife laughed, Lovell looked first at him
and then at C&aelig;sar. It came to me that Lovell was primed<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
to say something. At any rate, he turned to C&aelig;sar, and
said slowly, 'Tit for tat. If I do this for you, will you do
something for me?' And C&aelig;sar spoke up as usual,
without a second's hesitation, 'Of course I will.' And
then Scaife laughed again, just as Lovell said, 'All right,
I'll give Verney his "cap" before tea, and you will make
a fourth at bridge with us to-morrow afternoon.'"</p>

<p>"Oh, oh!" groaned John.</p>

<p>"Dash it all, don't look so wretched. There's not
much more. C&aelig;sar hesitated a moment. Then he said
quietly enough, 'Done!' Personally, I don't think Lovell
was playing&mdash;well&mdash;cricket, but I do know that he wanted
a fourth at bridge, because I'd just refused to make that
fourth myself. They play too high for me."</p>

<p>"It's awfully good of you to have told me this."</p>

<p>"Pray don't mention it! Hullo! What's up now?"</p>

<p>John's face was very red, and his fists were clenched.</p>

<p>"Nothing," he gasped. "Only this&mdash;I'd like to kill
Scaife. I'd like to cut off his infernal head."</p>

<p>The Caterpillar laughed indulgently. "Jonathan,
you're a rum 'un. You think it wicked to play cards on
Sunday; but you would like"&mdash;he imitated John's
trembling, passionate voice&mdash;"you would like to cut off
Scaife's infernal head."</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;I would," said John.</p>

<p>That same week he had a memorable talk with Warde;
recorded because it illustrates Warde's methods, and
because, ultimately, it came to be regarded by John as the
turning-point of his intellectual life. Since he had taken
the Lower Remove, John's energies of mind and body had
been concentrated upon improving himself at games.
Vaguely aware that some of the School-prizes were within
his grasp, he had not deemed them worth the winning. To
him, therefore, Warde abruptly began&mdash;</p>

<p>"You pride yourself upon being straight&mdash;eh, Verney?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes," said John, meeting Warde's blue eyes
not without misgiving.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, to me, you're about as straight as a note of
interrogation. I never see you without saying to myself,
'Is Verney going to bury his talents in the cricket-ground?'"</p>

<p>"Oh!"</p>

<p>"Some parents, too many of them, send their boys
here to make a few nice friends, to play games, to scrape
up the School with a remove once a year. That, I take it,
is not what Mrs. Verney wants?"</p>

<p>"N&mdash;no, sir."</p>

<p>"You ought to be in the Sixth&mdash;and you know it.
Twice, or oftener, you have deliberately taken things easy,
because you wanted a soft time of it during the summer
term, and because you wished to remain in the same form
with Desmond, who, intellectually, is your&mdash;inferior. Is
that square dealing with your people?"</p>

<p>John was silent, but red of countenance. Warde went
on, more vehemently&mdash;</p>

<p>"I know all about your co-operative system of work.
I have a harder name for it. And I know just what you
can do, and I want to see you do it, for your own sake, for
the sake of Mrs. Verney, and for the Hill's sake. I've
pushed you on at cricket a bit, haven't I? Yes. You
owe me something. Pay up by entering for a School-prize,
and winning it!"</p>

<p>"A School-prize?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Lord Charles Russell's Shakespeare Medal.
The exam. is next October. I'll coach you. Is it a
bargain?"</p>

<p>He held out his hand, staring frankly, but piercingly,
into John's eyes.</p>

<p>"All right, sir," said John, after a pause. "I'll try."</p>

<p>"And buck up for your remove."</p>

<p>John smiled feebly, and sighed.</p>

<h3><i>Black Spots</i></h3>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 22em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"The Avon bears to endless years<br /></span>

</div></div></div>


<p><span class="smcap">That evening</span> John told C&aelig;sar what Warde had said to
him, and then added, "I mean to have a shot at 'the Swan
of Avon.'" C&aelig;sar looked glum.</p>

<p>"But how about the remove? We'd agreed to stay
in the Second Fifth till Christmas. It's the jolliest form in
the school."</p>

<p>"If we put our backs&mdash;and heads&mdash;into Trials,<a name="FNanchor_29_29" id="FNanchor_29_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_29" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> we
can easily get a remove."</p>

<p>"Blow Trials."</p>

<p>John turned aside.</p>

<p>"Look here, Jonathan," said C&aelig;sar, eagerly. "To
please me, give up your swatting scheme. We can't spoil
the end of this jolly term."</p>

<p>He caught hold of John's arm, squeezing it affectionately.
Never had our hero been so sorely tempted.</p>

<p>"We must stick together, you and I," entreated Desmond.</p>

<p>"No," said John.</p>

<p>"As you please," C&aelig;sar replied coldly.</p>

<p>A detestable week followed. John tackled his Shakespeare
alone, working doggedly. Then, quite suddenly,<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span>
the giant gripped him. He had always possessed a remarkable
memory, and as a child he had learnt by heart
many passages out of the plays (a fact well known to the
crafty Warde); but these he had swallowed without
digesting them. Now he became keen, the keener because
he met with violent opposition from the Caterpillar and
the Duffer, who were of opinion that Shakespeare was a
"back number."</p>

<p>John won the prize, and on the following Speech Day
saw his mother's face radiant with pride and happiness,
as he received the Medal from the Head Master's hands.</p>

<p>"You look as pleased as if I'd got my Flannels," said
John.</p>

<p>"Surely this Medal is a greater thing?"</p>

<p>"Oh, mum, you don't know much about boys."</p>

<p>"Perhaps not, but," her eyes twinkled, "I know something
about Shakespeare, and he's a friend that will stand
by you when cricketing days are over."</p>

<p>"If you're pleased, so am I," said John.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Scaife got his Flannels; and at Lord's his fielding was
mentioned as the finest ever seen in a Public School match.
John witnessed the game from the top of the Trent coach,
and he stopped at Trent House. But he didn't enjoy his
exeat, because he knew that C&aelig;sar was in trouble. C&aelig;sar
owed Scaife thirteen pounds, and the fact that this debt
could not be paid without confession to his father was
driving him distracted. Scaife, it is true, laughed genially
at C&aelig;sar's distress. "Settle when you please," he said,
"but for Heaven's sake, don't peach to your governor!
Mine would laugh and pay up; yours will pay up and
make you swear not to touch another card while you're at
Harrow."</p>

<p>"Just what he <i>will</i> do," C&aelig;sar told John.</p>

<p>"And the best thing that could happen," John said
bluntly. "If you don't cut loose now, it will be much
worse next term."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rot," Desmond had replied. "I'm paying the usual
bill for learning a difficult game. That's how the Demon
puts it. But I've a turn for bridge, and now I can hold my
own. I'm better than Beaumont-Greene, and quite as
good as Lovell. The Demon, of course, is in another
class."</p>

<p>"And therefore he oughtn't to play with you. It's
robbery."</p>

<p>"Now you're talking bosh."</p>

<p>The Eton and Harrow match ended in another draw.
Time and Scaife's fielding saved Harrow from defeat. The
fact of a draw had significance. A draw spelled compromise.
John had indulged in a superstitious fancy
common enough to persons older than he. "If Harrow
wins," he put it to himself, "C&aelig;sar will triumph; if Eton
wins, C&aelig;sar will lose." When the match proved a draw,
John drew the conclusion that his pal would "funk"
telling the truth; an apprehension presently confirmed.</p>

<p>"I didn't tell the governor," said C&aelig;sar, when John
and he met. "My eldest brother, Hugo, is coming home,
and I shall screw it out of him. He's a good sort, and he's
going to marry a girl who is simply rolling. He'll fork out,
I know he will. I feel awfully cheery."</p>

<p>"I don't," said John.</p>

<p>He had good reason to fear that C&aelig;sar and he were
drifting apart. Now he worked by himself. And his
voice had broken. A small thing this, but John was sensible
that his singing voice touched corners in C&aelig;sar's soul to
which his speaking voice never penetrated. More, C&aelig;sar
and he had agreed to differ upon points of conscience other
than card-playing. And every point of conscientious
difference increases the distance between true friends in
geometrical progression. Poor Jonathan!</p>

<p>But we have his grateful testimony that Warde stood
by him. And Warde made him see life at Harrow (and
beyond) in a new light. Warde, indeed, decomposed the
light into primary colours, a sort of experiment in moral<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
chemistry, and not without fascination for an intelligent
boy. Sometimes, it became difficult to follow Warde&mdash;members
of the Alpine Club said that often it was impossible&mdash;because
he jumped where others crawled. And he
clipped words, phrases, thoughts so uncommonly short.</p>

<p>"You're beginning to see, Verney, eh? Scales crumbling
away, my boy. And strong sunshine hurts the eyes&mdash;at
first. Black spots are dancing before you. I know the
little devils."</p>

<p>Or again&mdash;</p>

<p>"This remove will wipe a bit more off the debt, won't
it? Ha, ha! I've made you reckon up what you owe
Mrs. Verney. But there are others&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I'm awfully grateful to you, sir."</p>

<p>"Never mind me."</p>

<p>"What do you mean, sir?"</p>

<p>"New Testament; Matthew; twenty-fifth chapter&mdash;I
forget verse.<a name="FNanchor_30_30" id="FNanchor_30_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_30" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> Look it up. Christ answers your question.
Make life easier and happier for some of the new boys.
Pass on gratitude. Set it a-rolling. See?"</p>

<p>John had appetite for such talk, but Warde never gave
much of it&mdash;half a dozen sentences, a smile, a nod of the
head, a keen look, and a striding off elsewhere. But when
John repeated what Warde had said to C&aelig;sar, that young
gentleman looked uneasy.</p>

<p>"Warde means well," he said; "and he's doing wonders
with the Manor, but I hope he's not going to make a
sort of tin parson of you?"</p>

<p>"As if he could!" said John.</p>

<p>"You're miles ahead of me, Jonathan."</p>

<p>"No, no."</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;yes."</p>

<p>"C&aelig;sar," said John, in desperation, "perhaps we <i>are</i>
sliding apart, but it isn't my fault, indeed it isn't. And
think what it means to&mdash;me. You've heaps of friends, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span>
I never was first, I know that. You can do without me,
but I can't do without you."</p>

<p>"Dear old Jonathan." C&aelig;sar held out his hand,
smiling.</p>

<p>"I'm a jealous ass, C&aelig;sar. And, as for calling me a
parson," he laughed scornfully, "why, I'd sooner walk
with you, even if you were the worst sinner in the world,
than with any saint that ever lived."</p>

<p>The feeling in John's voice drove C&aelig;sar's gay smile
from his face. Did he realize, possibly, for the first time,
that if John and he remained friends, he might drag John
down? Suddenly his face brightened.</p>

<p>"Jonathan," he said gravely, "to please you, I'll not
touch a card again this term, and we'll have such good
times these last three weeks that you'll forget the rest of it."</p>

<p>The Manor played in the cock-house match at cricket,
being but barely beaten by Damer's. Everybody admitted
that this glorious state of affairs was due to Warde's
coaching of the weaker members of the Eleven. Scaife
fielded brilliantly, and John, watching him, said to himself
that at such times the Demon was irresistible. Warde
invited the Eleven to dinner, and spoke of nothing but
football, much to every one's amusement.</p>

<p>"He's right," said the Caterpillar; "we're not cock-house
at cricket this year, but we may be at footer."</p>

<p>John spent his holidays abroad with his mother, and
when the School reassembled, he found himself in the
First Fifth <i>alone</i>. With satisfaction he reflected that this
was Lovell's last term, and Beaumont-Greene's, too.
Warde said a few words at first lock-up.</p>

<p>"We are going to be cock-house at footer, I hope," he
began, "and next term Scaife will show the School what<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span>
he can do at racquets; but I want more. I'm a glutton.
How about work, eh? Lot o' slacking last term. Is it
honest? You fellows cost your people a deal of money.
And it's well spent, if, <i>if</i> you tackle everything in school
life as you tackled Mr. Damer's last July. That's all."</p>

<p>"He's giving you what he gave me," said John.</p>

<p>"Good fellow, Warde," observed the Caterpillar; "in
his room every night after prayers to mug up his form
work."</p>

<p>"What?" Murmurs of incredulity.</p>

<p>"Fact, 'pon my word. And he never refuses a 'con'
to a fellow who wants it."</p>

<p>"He's paid for it," sneered Scaife.</p>

<p>The other boys nodded; enthusiasm was chilled. Yes,
of course Warde was paid for it. John caught Scaife's
eye.</p>

<p>"You don't believe that he's in love with his job, as
he told us?"</p>

<p>"Skittles&mdash;that!"</p>

<p>John looked solemn. He had a bomb to throw.</p>

<p>"Skittles, is it?" he echoed. The other boys turned
to listen. "Do you think he'd take a better paid
billet?"</p>

<p>Scaife laughed derisively. "Of course he would, like
a shot. But he's not likely to get the chance."</p>

<p>"He has just been offered the Head Mastership of
Wellborough. It's worth about four thousand a year."</p>

<p>"Pooh! who told you that?"</p>

<p>"C&aelig;sar's father."</p>

<p>"It's true," said C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>"And he refused it," said John, triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Then he's a fool," said Scaife, angrily. He marched
out of the room, slamming the door. But the Manor, as a
corporate body, when it heard of Warde's refusal to accept
promotion, was profoundly impressed. Thus the term
began with good resolutions upon the part of the better
sort.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span></p>

<p>Very soon, however, with the shortening days, bridge
began again. John made no protest, afraid of losing his
pal. He called himself coward, and considered the expediency
of learning bridge, so as to be in the same boat
with C&aelig;sar. C&aelig;sar told him that he had not asked his
brother Hugo for the thirteen pounds. Hugo, it seemed,
had come back from Teheran with a decoration and the
air of an ambassador. He spoke of his "services."</p>

<p>"I knew that Hugo would make me swear not to play
again," said C&aelig;sar to John, "and naturally I want to get
some of the plunder back. I am getting it back. I raked
thirty bob out of Beaumont-Greene last night."</p>

<p>John said nothing.</p>

<p>Presently it came to his ears that C&aelig;sar was getting
more plunder back. The Caterpillar, an agreeable gossip,
because he condemned nothing except dirt and low breeding,
told John that Beaumont-Greene was losing many
shekels. And about the middle of October C&aelig;sar said to
John&mdash;</p>

<p>"What do you think, old Jonathan? I've jolly nearly
paid off the Demon. And you wanted me to chuck the
thing. Nice sort of counsellor."</p>

<p>"Beaumont-Greene must have lost a pot?"</p>

<p>"You bet," said C&aelig;sar; "but that doesn't keep me
awake at night. He has got the <i>Imperishable Seamless
Whaleskin Boot</i> behind him."</p>

<p>Next time John met Beaumont-Greene he eyed him
sharply. The big fellow was pulpier than ever; his complexion
the colour of skilly. Yes; he looked much worried.
Perhaps the "Imperishable Boot" lasted too long. And,
nowadays, so many fellows wore shoes. Thus John to
himself.</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene, indeed, not only looked worried, he
was worried, hideously worried, and with excellent reason.
He had an absurdly, wickedly, large allowance, but not
more than a sovereign of it was left. More, he owed Scaife
twenty pounds, and Lovell another ten. Both these young<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span>
gentlemen had hinted plainly that they wanted to see their
money.</p>

<p>"I must have the stuff now," said Lovell, when Beaumont-Greene
asked for time. "I'm going to shoot a lot
this Christmas, and the governor makes me pay for my
cartridges."</p>

<p>"So does mine," said Scaife, grinning. He was quite
indifferent to the money, but he liked to see Beaumont-Greene
squirm. He continued suavely, "You ought to
settle before you leave. Ain't your people in Rome?
Yes. And you're going to join 'em. Why, hang it, some
Dago may stick a knife into you, and where should we be
then&mdash;hey? Your governor wouldn't settle a gambling
debt, would he?"</p>

<p>This was too true. Scaife grinned diabolically. He
knew that Beaumont-Greene's father was endeavouring to
establish a credit-account with the Recording Angel.
Originally a Nonconformist, he had joined the Church of
England after he had made his fortune (cf. <i>Shavings from
the Workshops of our Merchant Princes</i>, which appeared in
the pages of "Prattle"). Then, the famous inventor of
the Imperishable Boot had taken to endowing churches;
and he published pamphlets denouncing drink and
gambling, pamphlets sent to his son at Harrow, who (with
an eye to backsheesh) had praised his sire's prose somewhat
indiscreetly.</p>

<p>"You shall have your confounded money," said Beaumont-Greene,
violently.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said Scaife, sweetly. "When we asked you
to join us" (slight emphasis on the "us"), "we knew that
we could rely on you to settle promptly."</p>

<p>The Demon grinned for the third time, knowing that
he had touched a weak spot; not a difficult thing to do, if
you touched the big fellow at all. A young man of spirit
would have told his creditors to go to Jericho. Beaumont-Greene
might have said, "You have skinned me a bit. I
don't whine about that; I mean to pay up; but you'll<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span>
have to wait till I have the money. I'm stoney now."
Scaife and Lovell must have accepted this as an ultimatum.
But Beaumont-Greene's wretched pride interfered. He
had posed as a sort of Golden Youth. To confess himself
pinchbeck seemed an unspeakable humiliation.</p>

<p>Men have been known to take to drink under the impending
sword of dishonour. Beaumont-Greene swallowed
instead large quantities of food at the Creameries; and
then wrote to his father, saying that he would like to
have a cheque for thirty pounds by return of post. He was
leaving Harrow, he pointed out, and he wished to give his
friends some handsome presents. Young Desmond, for
instance, the great Minister's son, had been kind to him
(Beaumont-Greene prided himself upon this touch), and
Scaife, too, he was under obligations to Scaife, who would
be a power by-and-by, and so forth.... To confess
frankly that he owed thirty pounds gambled away at cards
required more cheek than our stout youth possessed. His
father refused to play bridge on principle, because he could
never remember how many trumps were out.</p>

<p>The father answered by return of post, but enclosed no
cheque. He pointed out to his dear Thomas that giving
handsome presents with another's money was an objectionable
habit. Thomas received a large, possibly too large
an allowance. He must exercise self-denial, if he wished
to make presents. His quarterly allowance would be paid
as usual next Christmas, and not a minute before. There
would be time then to reconsider the propriety of giving
young Desmond a suitable gift....</p>

<p>Common sense told Beaumont-Greene to show this
letter to Scaife and Lovell. But he saw the Demon's
derisive grin, and recoiled from it.</p>

<p>At this moment temptation seized him relentlessly.
Beaumont-Greene never resisted temptation. For fun,
so he put it, he would write the sort of letter which his
father ought to have written, and which would have put
him at his ease. It ran thus<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<div class="lett1"><p>"<span class="smcap">My Dear Thomas</span>,</p>

<p>"No doubt you will want to give some leaving
presents, and a spread or two. I should like my son to do
the thing handsomely. You know better than I how much
this will cost, but I am prepared to send you, say, twenty-five
or thirty pounds for such a purpose. Or, you can have the
bills sent to me.</p>

<p class="author">"With love,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">"Your affectionate father,</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2em;">"<span class="smcap">George Beaumont-Greene</span>."</span></p>
</div>
<p>Beaumont-Greene, like the immortal Mr. Toots, rather
fancied himself as a letter-writer. The longer he looked
at his effusion, the more he liked it. His handwriting was
not unlike his father's&mdash;modelled, indeed, upon it. With a
little careful manipulation of a few letters&mdash;&mdash;!</p>

<p>The day was cold, but Beaumont-Greene suddenly
found himself in a perspiration. None the less, it seemed
easier to forge a letter than to avow himself penniless.
Detection? Impossible! Two or three tradesmen in
Harrow would advance the money if he showed them this
letter. Next Christmas they would be paid. Within a
quarter of an hour he made up his mind to cross the
Rubicon, and crossed it with undue haste. He forged the
letter, placed it in an envelope which had come from Rome,
and went to his tailor's.</p>

<p>Under pretext of looking at patterns, he led the man
aside.</p>

<p>"You can do me a favour," he began, in his usual,
heavy, hesitating manner.</p>

<p>"With pleasure," said the tradesman, smiling. Then,
seeing an opportunity, he added, "You are leaving Harrow,
Mr. Beaumont-Greene, but I trust, sir, you will not take
your custom with you. We have always tried to please
you."</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene, in his turn, saw opportunity.</p>

<p>"Yes, yes," he answered. Then he produced the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
letter, envelope and all. "I have here a letter from my
father, who is in Rome. I'll read it to you. No; you
can read it yourself."</p>

<p>The tailor read the letter.</p>

<p>"Very handsome," he replied; "<i>very</i> handsome indeed,
sir. Your father is a true gentleman."</p>

<p>"It happens," said Beaumont-Greene, more easily, for
the thing seemed to be simpler than he had anticipated&mdash;"it
happens that I <i>do</i> want to make some presents, but
I'm not going to buy them here. I shall send to the Stores,
you know. I have their catalogue."</p>

<p>"Just so, sir. Excellent place the Stores for nearly
everything; except, perhaps, my line."</p>

<p>"I should not think of buying clothes there. But at
the Stores one must pay cash. I've not got the cash, and
my father is in Rome. I should like to have the money
to-day, if possible. Will you oblige me?"</p>

<p>The tradesman hesitated. In the past there have been
grave scandals connected with lending money to boys.
And Harrow tradesmen are at the mercy of the Head
Master. If a school-tailor be put out of bounds, he can
put up his shutters at once. Still&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'll let you have the money," said the man, eyeing
Beaumont-Greene keenly.</p>

<p>"Thanks."</p>

<p>The tailor observed a slight flush and a sudden intake
of breath&mdash;signs which stirred suspicion.</p>

<p>"Will you take it in notes, sir?"</p>

<p>Here Beaumont-Greene made his first blunder. He
had an ill-defined idea that paper was dangerous stuff.</p>

<p>"In gold, please."</p>

<p>He forgot that gold is not easily sent in a letter. The
tailor hesitated, but he had gone too far to back out.</p>

<p>"Very well, sir. I have not twenty-five pounds&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Thirty, if you please. I shall want thirty."</p>

<p>"I have not quite that amount here, but I can get
it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span></p>

<p>When the man came back with a small canvas bag in
his hand, Beaumont-Greene had pocketed the letter. He
received the money, counted it, thanked the tailor, and
turned to go.</p>

<p>"If you please, sir&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Yes?"</p>

<p>"I should like to keep your father's letter, sir. As a
form of receipt, sir. When you settle I'll return it. If&mdash;if
anything should happen to&mdash;to you, sir, where would I
be?"</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene's temper showed itself.</p>

<p>"You all talk as if I was on my death-bed," he said.</p>

<p>The tailor stared. Others, then, had suggested to this
large, unwholesome youth the possibility of premature
decease.</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir, but we do live in the valley of shadders.
My wife's step-father, as fine and hearty a specimen as
you'd wish to see, sir, was taken only last month; at
breakfast, too, as he was chipping his third egg."</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene said loftily, "Blow your wife's step-father
and his third egg. Here's the letter."</p>

<p>He flung down the letter and marched out of the shop.
The tradesman looked at him, shaking his head. "He'll
never come back," he muttered. "I know his sort too
well." Then, business happening to be slack, he re-read
the letter before putting it away. Then he whistled softly
and read it for the third time, frowning and biting his lips.
The "Beaumont-Greene" in the signature and on the
envelope did not look to be written by the same hand.</p>

<p>"There's something fishy here," muttered the tradesman.
"I must show this to Amelia."</p>

<p>It was his habit to consult his wife in emergencies. The
chief cutter and two assistants said that Amelia was the
power behind the throne. Amelia read the letter, listened
to what her husband had to say, stared hard at the envelope,
and delivered herself&mdash;</p>

<p>"The hand that wrote the envelope never wrote the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[152]</a></span>
letter, that's plain&mdash;to me. Now, William, you've got me
and the children to think of. This may mean the loss of
our business, and worse, too. You put on your hat and go
straight to the Manor. Mr. Warde's a gentleman, and I
don't think he'll let me and the children suffer for your
foolishness. Don't you wait another minute."</p>

<p>Nor did he.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>After prayers that night, Warde asked Beaumont-Greene
to come to his study. Beaumont-Greene obeyed,
smiling blandly. Within three weeks he was leaving;
doubtless Warde wanted to say something civil. The big
fellow was feeling quite himself. He had paid Scaife and
Lovell, not without a little pardonable braggadocio.</p>

<p>"You fellows have put me to some inconvenience," he
said. "I make it a rule not to run things fine, but after all
thirty quid is no great sum. Here you are."</p>

<p>"We don't want to drive you into the workhouse," said
Scaife. "Thanks. Give you your revenge any time. I
dare say between now and the end of the term you'll have
most of it back."</p>

<p>Warde asked Beaumont-Greene to sit down in a particular
chair, which faced the light from a large lamp.
Then he took up an envelope. Suddenly cold chills trickled
down Beaumont-Greene's spine. He recognized the envelope.
That scoundrel had betrayed him. Not for a
moment, however, did he suppose that the forgery had been
detected.</p>

<p>"On the strength of this letter," said Warde, gravely,
"you borrowed thirty pounds from a tradesman?"</p>

<p>Denial being fatuous, Beaumont-Greene said&mdash;</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"You know, I suppose, that Harrow tradesmen are
expressly forbidden to lend boys money?"</p>

<p>"I am hardly a boy, sir. And&mdash;er&mdash;under the circumstances&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Warde smiled very grimly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ah&mdash;under the circumstances. Have you any objection
to telling me the exact circumstances?"</p>

<p>"Not at all, sir. I wished to make some presents to
my friends. I am going to give a large leaving-breakfast."</p>

<p>"Oh! Still, thirty pounds is a large sum&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Not to my father, sir. I&mdash;er&mdash;thought of coming to
you, sir, with that letter."</p>

<p>"Did you?"</p>

<p>Warde took the letter from the envelope, and glanced at
it with faint interest, so Beaumont-Greene thought. Then
he picked up a magnifying glass and played with it. It was
a trick of his to pick up objects on his desk, and turn them
in his thin, nervous fingers. Beaumont-Greene was not
seriously alarmed. He had great faith in a weapon which
had served him faithfully, his lying tongue.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. I thought you would be willing to advance
the money for a few days, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And then?"</p>

<p>"And then I thought I wouldn't bother you. It never
occurred to me that I was getting a tradesman into trouble.
I hope you won't be hard on him, sir."</p>

<p>"I shall not be hard on him," said Warde, "because"&mdash;for
a moment his eyes flashed&mdash;"because he came to me
and confessed his fault; but I won't deny that I gave him
a very uncomfortable quarter of an hour. He sat in your
chair."</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene shuffled uneasily.</p>

<p>"Have you this thirty pounds in your pocket?" asked
Warde, casually.</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene began to regret his haste in settling.</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"Some of it?"</p>

<p>"None of it."</p>

<p>"You sent it to London? To buy these handsome
presents?"</p>

<p>"Ye-es, sir."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span></p>

<p>"You hadn't much time. Lock-up's early, and you
received the money in gold. Did you buy Orders?"</p>

<p>Beaumont-Greene's head began to buzz. He found
himself wondering why Warde was speaking in this smooth,
quiet voice, so different from his usual curt, incisive tones.</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"At the Harrow post-office?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Ah."</p>

<p>Again the house-master picked up the letter, but this
time he didn't lay down the lens. Instead he used it, very
deliberately. Beaumont-Greene shivered; with difficulty
he clenched his teeth, so as to prevent them clicking like
castanets. Then Warde held up the sheet of paper to the
light of the lamp. Obviously he wished to examine the
watermark. The paper was thin notepaper, the kind that
is sold everywhere for foreign correspondence. Beaumont-Greene,
economical in such matters, had bought a couple
of quires when his people went abroad. The paper he had
bought did not quite match the Roman envelope. Warde
opened a drawer, from which he took some thin paper.
This also he held up to the light.</p>

<p>"It's an odd coincidence," he said, tranquilly; "your
father in Rome uses the same notepaper that I buy here.
But the envelope is Italian?"</p>

<p>He spoke interrogatively, but the wretch opposite had
lost the power of speech. He collapsed. Warde rose,
throwing aside his quiet manner as if it were a drab-coloured
cloak. Now he was himself, alert, on edge,
sanguine.</p>

<p>"You fool!" he exclaimed; "you clumsy fool! Why,
a child could find you out. And you&mdash;you have dared to
play with such an edged tool as forgery. Now, do the one
thing which is left to you: make a clean breast of it to me&mdash;at
once."</p>

<p>In imposing this command, a command which he knew
would be obeyed, inasmuch as he perceived that he<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
dominated the weak, grovelling creature in front of him,
Warde overlooked the possibility that this boy's confession
might implicate other boys. Already he had formed in
his mind a working hypothesis to account for this forged
letter. The fellow, no doubt, was in debt to some Harrow
townsman.</p>

<p>"For whom did you <i>steal</i> this money? To whom did
you pay it to-day? Answer!"</p>

<p>And he was answered.</p>

<p>"I owed the money to Scaife and Lovell."</p>

<p>Then he told the story of the card-playing. At the last
word he fell on his knees, blubbering.</p>

<p>"Get up," said Warde, sharply. "Pull yourself together
if you can."</p>

<p>The master began to walk up and down the room,
frowning and biting his lips. From time to time he glanced
at Beaumont-Greene. Seeing his utter collapse, he rang
the bell, answered by the ever-discreet Dumbleton.</p>

<p>"Dumbleton, take Mr. Beaumont-Greene to the sick-room.
There is no one in it, I believe?"</p>

<p>"No, sir."</p>

<p>"You will fetch what he may require for the night;
quietly, you understand."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>"Follow Dumbleton," Warde addressed Beaumont-Greene.
"You will consider yourself under arrest. Your
meals will be brought to you. You will hold no communication
with anybody except Dumbleton and me;
you will send no messages; you will write no notes. Do
you hear?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Then go."</p>

<p>Dumbleton opened the door. Young man and servant
passed out and into the passage beyond. Warde waited
one moment, then he followed them into the passage; but
instead of going upstairs, he paused for an instant with his
fingers upon the handle of the door which led from the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
private side to the boys' quarters. He sighed as he passed
through.</p>

<p>At this moment Lovell was sitting in his room alone
with Scaife. They had no suspicion of what had taken
place in the study. In the afternoon there had been a match
with an Old Harrovian team, and both Scaife and Lovell
had played for the School. But as yet neither had got his
Flannels. As Warde passed through the private side door,
Scaife was saying angrily&mdash;</p>

<p>"I believe Challoner" (Challoner was captain of the
football Eleven and a monitor) "has a grudge against us.
If we had a chance&mdash;and we had&mdash;of getting our Flannels
last year, why isn't it a cert. this, eh?"</p>

<p>Lovell shrugged his shoulders.</p>

<p>"It is a cert.," he answered; "and you're right. Challoner
doesn't like us, and it amuses him to keep us out
of our just rights. The monitors know I detest 'em, and
they don't think you're called the Demon for nothing.
Challoner is more of a monitor than a footer-player. How
about a rubber? There's just time."</p>

<p>"I don't mind."</p>

<p>Lovell went to the door and opened it.</p>

<p>"Bo-o-o-o-o-o-y!"</p>

<p>The familiar cry&mdash;that imperious call which makes an
Harrovian feel himself master of more or less willing slaves&mdash;echoed
through the house. Immediately the night-fag
came running; it was not considered healthy to keep
Lovell waiting.</p>

<p>"Ask Beaumont-Greene to come up here and&mdash;&mdash;"
He paused. Warde had just turned the corner, and was
approaching. Lovell hesitated. Then he repeated what
he had just said, with a slight variation for Warde's benefit.
"Tell him I want to ask him a question about the house-subscriptions."</p>

<p>"Right," said the fag, bustling off.</p>

<p>Lovell waited to receive his house-master. He had
very good manners.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span></p>

<p>"Can I do anything for you, sir?" he asked.</p>

<p>"Yes," said Warde, deliberately. He entered Lovell's
room and looked at Scaife, who rose at once.</p>

<p>"I wish to speak with you alone, Lovell."</p>

<p>"Certainly, sir. Won't you sit down?"</p>

<p>Warde waited till Scaife had closed the door; then he
said quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Lovell, does Beaumont-Greene owe you money?"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Lovell betrayed</span> his astonishment by a slight start;
however, he faced Warde with a smile. Warde, clean-shaven,
alert, with youthful figure, looked but little older
than his pupil. For a moment the two stared steadily at
each other; then, very politely, Lovell said&mdash;</p>

<p>"No, sir, he does not."</p>

<p>Warde continued curtly, "Then he has paid you what
he did owe you?"</p>

<p>Lovell nodded, shrugging his shoulders. Plainly, Warde
had discovered the fact of the debt. Probably that fool
Beaumont-Greene had applied to his father, and the father
had written to Warde. It was unthinkable that Warde
knew more than this. Having reached this conclusion,
Lovell turned over in his mind two or three specious lies
that might meet the exigency.</p>

<p>"Yes," he replied, with apparent frankness, "Beaumont-Greene
did owe me money, and he has paid me."</p>

<p>After a slight pause, Warde said quietly, "It is my duty,
as your tutor, to ask you how Beaumont-Greene became
indebted to you?"</p>

<p>"I lent him the money," said Lovell.</p>

<p>"Ah! Please call 'Boy.'"</p>

<p>Lovell went into the passage. Had he an intuition that
he was about to call "Boy" for the last time, or did the
pent-up excitement find an outlet in sound? He had never
called "Boy" so loudly or clearly. The night-fag scurried
up again.</p>

<p>"Tell him to send Scaife here," said Warde.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>Lovell's florid face paled. Scaife would introduce complications.
And yet, if it had come to Warde's ears that
Beaumont-Greene was in debt to two of his schoolfellows,
and if he had found out the name of one, it was not surprising
that he knew the name of the other also. As he gave the
fag the message, he regretted that Scaife and he could not
have a minute's private conversation together.</p>

<p>"You lent Beaumont-Greene ten pounds, Lovell?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>Scaife came in, cool, handsomer than usual because of
the sparkle in his eyes.</p>

<p>"Shut the door, Scaife. Look at me, please. Beaumont-Greene
owed you money?"</p>

<p>Scaife glanced at Lovell, whose left eyelid quivered.</p>

<p>"Kindly stand behind Scaife, Lovell. Thank you.
Answer my question, Scaife."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir; he owed me money."</p>

<p>"Have <i>you</i> lent him money, too?" said Lovell.</p>

<p>It was admirably done&mdash;the hint cleverly conveyed, the
mild amazement. Warde smiled grimly. Scaife understood,
and took his cue.</p>

<p>"Yes; I have lent him money," said he, after a slight
pause.</p>

<p>"Twenty pounds?"</p>

<p>"I believe, sir, that is the amount."</p>

<p>"And can you offer me any explanation why Beaumont-Greene,
whose father, to my knowledge, has always given
him a very large allowance, should borrow thirty pounds
of you two?"</p>

<p>"I haven't the smallest idea, have you, Lovell?"</p>

<p>"No," said Lovell. "Unless his younger brother, who is at
Eton, has got into trouble. He's very fond of his brothers."</p>

<p>"Um! You speak up for your&mdash;friend."</p>

<p>Lovell frowned. "A friend, sir&mdash;no."</p>

<p>"Of course," said Warde, reflectively, "if it is true
that Beaumont-Greene borrowed this money to help a
brother&mdash;&mdash;"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span></p>

<p>He paused, staring at Lovell. From the bottom of a
big heart he was praying that Lovell would not lie.</p>

<p>"Beaumont-Greene certainly gave me to understand
that the affair was pressing. Having the money, I hadn't
the heart to refuse."</p>

<p>"But you pressed for repayment?" said Warde, sharply.</p>

<p>"That is true, sir. I'm on an allowance; and I shall
have many expenses this holidays."</p>

<p>"You, Scaife, asked for your money?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>"Well, between you, you have driven this unhappy
wretch into crime."</p>

<p>"Crime, sir?"</p>

<p>At last their self-possession abandoned them. Crime
is a word which looms large in the imaginations of youth.
What had Beaumont-Greene done?</p>

<p>"What crime, sir?"</p>

<p>Scaife, the more self-possessed, although fully two
years the younger, asked the question.</p>

<p>"Forgery."</p>

<p>"Forgery?" Lovell repeated. He was plainly shocked.</p>

<p>"The idiot!" exclaimed Scaife.</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;forgery. Have you anything to say? It is a
time when the truth, all the truth, might be accepted as an
extenuating circumstance. I speak to you first, Lovell.
You're a Sixth Form boy&mdash;remember, I have been one
myself&mdash;and it is your duty to help me."</p>

<p>"I beg pardon, sir," Lovell replied. "I have never
considered it my duty as a Sixth Form boy to play the
usher."</p>

<p>"Nor did I; but you ought to work on parallel lines
with us. You accepted the privileges of the Sixth."</p>

<p>Lovell's flush deepened.</p>

<p>"More," continued Warde, "you know that we, the
masters, have implicit trust in the Sixth Form, a trust but
seldom betrayed. For instance, I should not think of
entering your room without tapping on the door; under<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
ordinary circumstances I should accept your bare word
unhesitatingly. I say emphatically that if you, knowing
these things, have accepted the privileges of your order
with the deliberate intention of ignoring its duties, you have
not acted like a man of honour."</p>

<p>"Sir!"</p>

<p>"Don't bluff! Now, for the last time, will you give me
what I have given you&mdash;trust?"</p>

<p>"I have nothing more to say," Lovell answered stiffly.</p>

<p>"And you, Scaife?"</p>

<p>"I am sorry, sir, that Beaumont-Greene has been such
a fool. We lent him this money, because he wanted it
badly; and he said he would pay us back before the end
of the term."</p>

<p>"You stick to that story?"</p>

<p>"Why, yes, sir. Why should we tell you a lie?"</p>

<p>"Ah, why, indeed?" sighed Warde. Then his voice
grew hard and sharp. The persuasiveness, the carefully-framed
sentences, gave place to his curtest manner. "This
matter," said he, "is out of my hands. The Head Master
will deal with it. I must ask you for your keys, Lovell."</p>

<p>"And if I refuse to give them up?"</p>

<p>"Then we must break into your boxes. Thanks." He
took the keys. "Follow me, please."</p>

<p>The pair followed him into the private side, upstairs,
and into the sick-room. There were three beds in it; upon
one sat Beaumont-Greene. His complexion turned a
sickly drab when he saw Lovell and Scaife. He even
glanced at the window with a hunted expression. The
window was three stories from the ground, and heavily
barred ever since a boy in delirium had tried to jump
from it.</p>

<p>"Your night-things will be brought to you," said Warde.</p>

<p>He went out slowly. The boys heard the key turn in
the massive lock. They were prisoners. Scaife walked
up to Beaumont-Greene.</p>

<p>"You told Warde about the bridge?"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span></p>

<p>"Ye-es; I had to. Scaife, don't look at me like that.
Lovell"&mdash;his voice broke into a terrified scream&mdash;"don't
let him hit me. I couldn't help it&mdash;I swear I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"You cur!" said Scaife. "I wouldn't touch you with
a forty-foot pole."</p>

<p>Just what passed between Warde and the Head Master
must be surmised. Carefully hidden in Lovell's boxes were
found cards and markers. Upon the latter remained the
results of the last game played, and under the winning
column a rough calculation in pounds, shillings, and pence.
There were no names.</p>

<p>Next day, during first school, a notice came round
to each Form to be in the Speech-room at 8.30. Not a
boy knew or guessed the reason of this summons. The
Manorites, aware that three of their House were in the sick-room,
believed that an infectious disease had broken out.
Only Desmond, John, and the Caterpillar experienced
heart-breaking fears that a catastrophe had taken place.</p>

<p>When the School assembled at half-past eight, the
monitors came in, followed by the Head Master in cap and
gown. Then, a moment later, the School Custos entered
with Scaife. They sat down upon a small bench near the
door. Immediately the whispers, the shuffling of feet, the
occasional cough, died down into a thrilling silence. The
Head Master stood up.</p>

<p>He was a man of singularly impressive face and figure.
And his voice had what may be described as an edge to
it&mdash;the cutting quality so invaluable to any speaker who
desires to make a deep impression upon his audience. He
began his address in the clear, cold accents of one who
sets forth facts which can neither be controverted nor
ignored. Slowly, inexorably, without wasting a word or a
second, he told the School what had happened. Then he
paused.</p>

<p>As his voice melted away, the boys moved restlessly.
Upon their faces shone a curious excitement and relief.
Gambling in its many-headed forms is too deeply rooted in<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
human hearts to awaken any great antipathy. So far,
then, the sympathy of the audience lay with the culprits;
this the Head Master knew.</p>

<p>When he spoke again, his voice had changed, subtly,
but unmistakably.</p>

<p>"You were afraid," he said, "that I had something
worse&mdash;ah, yes, unspeakably worse&mdash;to tell you. Thank
God, this is not one of those cases from which every clean,
manly boy must recoil in disgust. But, on that account,
don't blind yourselves to the issues involved. This playing
of bridge&mdash;a game you have seen your own people playing
night after night, perhaps&mdash;is harmless enough in itself.
I can say more&mdash;it is a game, and hence its fascination,
which calls into use some of the finest qualities of the brain:
judgment, memory, the faculty of making correct deductions,
foresight, and patience. It teaches restraint; it
makes for pleasant fellowship. It does all this and more,
provided that it never degenerates into gambling. The
very moment that the game becomes a gamble, if any one
of the players is likely to lose a sum greater than he can
reasonably afford to pay, greater than he would cheerfully
spend upon any other form of entertainment, then bridge
becomes cursed. And because you boys have not the
experience to determine the difference between a mere game
and a gamble, card-playing is forbidden you, and rightly
so. Now, let us consider what has happened. A stupid,
foolish fellow, playing with boys infinitely cleverer than
himself, has lost a sum of money which he could not pay.
To obtain the means of paying it, he deliberately forged a
letter and a signature. And then followed the inevitable
lying&mdash;lie upon lie. That is always the price of lies&mdash;'to
lie on still.'</p>

<p>"I would mitigate the punishment, if I could, but I
must think of the majority. This sort of malignant disease
must be cut out. Two of the three offenders are young
men; they were leaving at the end of this term. They
will leave, instead&mdash;to-day. The third boy is much<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
younger. Because of his youth, I have been persuaded by
his house-master to give him a further chance."</p>

<p>Again he paused. Then he exclaimed loudly, "Scaife!"</p>

<p>Scaife stood up, very pale. "Here, sir!"</p>

<p>"Scaife, you will go into the Fourth Form Room,<a name="FNanchor_31_31" id="FNanchor_31_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_31" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> and
prepare to receive the punishment which no member of
the Eleven should ever deserve."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>John sat with his Form while the Head Master was
addressing the School. Not far off was the Caterpillar,
less cool than usual, so John remarked. His collar, for
instance, seemed to be too tight; and he moved restlessly
upon his chair. Many very brave men become nervous
when a great danger has passed them by. Egerton said
afterwards, "I felt like getting down a hole, and pulling
the hole after me. Not my own. Some Yankee's, you
know." Still, he displayed remarkable self-possession
under trying circumstances. Two of Lovell's particular
friends were seen to turn the colour of Cheddar cheese.
But Desmond, so John noticed, grew red rather than yellow.
Nor did he tremble, but his fists were clenched, and his
eyes kindled.</p>

<p>As Scaife left the Speech-room, followed by Titchener
(the provider of birches, whose duty it is to see that boys
about to be swished are properly prepared to receive
punishment), the boys began to shuffle in their places.
But the Head Master held up his hand. It was then that
Lovell's two particular friends, who had partially recovered,
felt that the earth was once more slipping from under
them.</p>

<p>"It takes four to play bridge." The Caterpillar's
fingers went to his collar again. "In this case there must
have been a fourth, possibly a fifth and a sixth. Not more,
I think, because the secret was too well kept. We are confronted
with the disagreeable fact that three boys are going
to receive the most severe punishments I can inflict, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
that another escapes scot-free. <i>For I do not know the&mdash;name&mdash;of&mdash;the&mdash;fourth.</i>"</p>

<p>The Head Master waited to let each deliberate word
soak in. Perhaps he had calculated the effect of his voice
upon a boy of sensibility and imagination. That Scaife,
his friend, should suffer the indignity of a swishing, and
that he should escape scot-free, seemed to C&aelig;sar Desmond
not a bit of rare good fortune&mdash;as it appeared to the others&mdash;but
an incredible miscarriage of justice. To submit tamely
to such a burden was unthinkable. He sprang to his feet,
ardent, impetuous, afire with the spirit which makes men
accept death rather than dishonour; and then, in a voice
that rang through the room, thrilling the coldest and most
callous heart, he exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"I was the fourth."</p>

<p>A curious sound escaped from the audience&mdash;a gasp of
surprise, of admiration, and of dismay; at least, so the
Head Master interpreted it. And looking at the faces
about him, he read approval or disapproval, according as
each boy betrayed the feeling in his heart.</p>

<p>"You, Desmond?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>The Caterpillar rose slowly. He was cool enough now.</p>

<p>"I was the fifth."</p>

<p>But Lovell's two particular friends sat tight, as they
put it. Let us not blame them.</p>

<p>"You, Egerton?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>For a moment the Head Master hesitated. Into his
mind there flashed the image of two notable figures&mdash;the
fathers whom he had entreated to send sons to the Manor.
If&mdash;if by so doing he had compassed the boys' ruin, could
he ever have forgiven himself? But now, the boys themselves
had justified his action; they had proved worthy
of their breeding and the traditions of the Hill.</p>

<p>"Come here," he said.</p>

<p>When they stood opposite to him, he continued<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[166]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"You give yourselves up to receive the punishment I
am about to inflict upon Scaife?"</p>

<p>The boys did not answer, save with their eyes. The
silence in the great room was so profound that John made
sure that the beating of his heart must be heard by everybody.</p>

<p>"I shall not punish you. This voluntary confession
has done much to redeem your fault. Meet me in my
study at nine this evening, and I will talk to you. When
I came here I hardly hoped to find saints, but I did expect
to find&mdash;gentlemen. And I have not been disappointed."
He addressed the others. "You will return to your
boarding-houses, and quietly, if you please."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The immediate and most noticeable effect of Lovell's
expulsion was the loss of the next House match. Damer's
defeated the Manor easily. Some of the fags whispered
to each other that the injuries inflicted by the Head Master
on Scaife had been so severe as to incapacitate the star-player
of the House. Two boys had concealed themselves
in the Armoury (which is just below the Fourth Form
Room) upon the morning when Scaife was flogged. But
they reported&mdash;nothing. However severe the punishment
might have been, Scaife received it without a whimper.</p>

<p>In truth, Scaife received but one cut, and that a light
one. The Head Master wished to lay stripes upon the boy's
heart, not his body. When he saw him prepared to receive
punishment, he said gravely&mdash;</p>

<p>"I have never flogged a member of the Eleven. And
now, at the last moment, I offer you the choice between a
flogging and expulsion."</p>

<p>"I prefer to be flogged."</p>

<p><i>And then&mdash;one cut.</i></p>

<p>But Scaife never forgot the walk from the Yard to the
Manor, after execution. He was too proud to run, too
proud not to face the boys he happened to meet. They
turned aside their eyes from his furious glare. But he met<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
no members of his own House. They had the delicacy to
leave the coast clear. When he reached his room, he found
Desmond alone. Desmond said nervously&mdash;</p>

<p>"I asked Warde if we could have breakfast here this
morning, instead of going into Hall. I've got some ripping
salmon."</p>

<p>Scaife had faced everything with a brazen indifference,
but the sympathy in his friend's voice overpowered him.
He flung himself upon the sofa by the window and wept,
not as a boy weeps, but with the cruel, grinding sobs of a
man. He wept for his stained pride, for his vain-glory,
not because he had sinned and caused others to sin. The
boy watching him, seeing the hero self-abased, hearing his
heartbreaking sobs, interpreted very differently those
sounds. Infinitely distressed, turning over and over in
his mind some soothing phrases, some word of comfort
and encouragement, Desmond waited till the first paroxysm
had passed. What he said then shall not be set down in cold
print. You may be sure he proved that friendship between
two strong, vigorous boys is no frail thread, but a golden
chain which adversity strengthens and refines. Scaife
rose up with his heart softened, not by his own tears, but
by the tears he saw in Desmond's eyes.</p>

<p>"I'm all right now," he said. Then, with frowning
brows, he added thoughtfully, "I deserve what I got for
being a fool. I ought to have foreseen that such a swine
as Beaumont-Greene would be sure to betray us sooner
or later. I shall be wiser next time."</p>

<p>"Next&mdash;time?" The dismay in Desmond's voice made
Scaife smile.</p>

<p>"Don't worry, C&aelig;sar. No more bridge for me; but,"
he laughed harshly, "the leopard can't change his spots,
and he won't give up hunting because he has fallen into
a trap, and got out of it. Come, let's tackle the salmon."</p>

<p>The winter term came to an end, and the School broke
up. Upon the evening of the last Sunday, Warde said a
few words to John.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span></p>

<p>"I propose to make some changes in the house," he
said abruptly. "Would you like to share No. 7 with
Desmond?"</p>

<p>No. 7 was the jolliest two-room at the Manor. It overlooked
the gardens, and was larger than some three-rooms.
Then John remembered Scaife and the Duffer.</p>

<p>"Desmond has been with Scaife ever since he came to
the house, sir."</p>

<p>"True. But I'm going to give Scaife a room to himself.
He's entitled to it as the future Captain of the Eleven.
That is&mdash;settled. You and Duff must part. He's two
forms below you in the school, and never likely to soar
much higher than the Second Fifth. Next term you will
be in the Sixth, and by the summer I hope Desmond will
have joined you. You will find<a name="FNanchor_32_32" id="FNanchor_32_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_32" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> together. Of course
Scaife can find with you, if you wish. I've spoken to him
and Desmond."</p>

<p>And so, John's fondest hope was realized. When he
came back to the Manor, Desmond and he spent much time
and rather more money than they could afford in making
No. 7 the cosiest room in the house. Consciences were
salved thus:&mdash;John bought for Desmond some picture or
other decorative object which cost more money than he
felt justified in spending on himself; then Desmond made
John a similar present. It was whipping the devil round
the stump, John said, but oh! the delight of giving his
friend something he coveted, and receiving presents from
him in return.</p>

<p>During this term, Scaife became one of the school
racquet-players. In many ways he was admittedly the
most remarkable boy at Harrow, the Admirable Crichton
who appears now and again in every decade. He won the
high jump and the hurdle-race. These triumphs kept him
out of mischief, and occupied every minute of his time. He
associated with the "Bloods," and one day Desmond told<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
John that he considered himself to have been "dropped"
by this tremendous swell. John discreetly held his tongue;
but in his own mind, as before, he was convinced that
Scaife and Desmond would come together again. The
inexorable circumstance of Scaife's superiority at games had
separated the boys, but only for a brief season. Desmond
would become a "Blood" soon, and then it would be John's
turn to be "dropped." Being a philosopher, our hero did
not worry too much over the future, but made the most of
the present, with a grateful and joyous heart. In his
humility, he was unable to measure his influence on
Desmond. In athletic pursuits an inferior, in all intellectual
attainments he was pulling far ahead of his friend. The
artful Warde had a word to say, which gave John food
for thought.</p>

<p>"You can never equal your friend at cricket or footer,
Verney. If you wish to score, it is time to play your own
game."</p>

<p>Shortly after this, John realized that Warde had read
C&aelig;sar aright. Charles Desmond's son, as has been said,
acclaimed quality wherever he met it. John's intellectual
advance amazed and then fascinated him. When John
discovered this, he worked harder. Warde smiled. John
ran second for the Prize Poem. He had genuine feeling
for Nature, but he lacked as yet the technical ability to
display it. A more practised versifier won the prize; but
John's taste for history and literature secured him the
Bourchier, not without a struggle which whetted to keenness
every faculty he possessed. More, to his delight, he
realized that his enthusiasm was contagious. C&aelig;sar
entered eagerly into his friend's competitions; struggle
and strife appealed to the Irishman. He talked over John's
themes, read his verses, and predicted triumphs. Warde
told John that C&aelig;sar Desmond might have stuck in the
First Fifth, had it not been for this quickening of the clay.
The days succeeded each other swiftly and smoothly.
Warde was seen to smile more than ever during this term.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
Certain big fellows who opposed him were leaving or had
already left. Bohun, now Head of the House, was a sturdy,
straightforward monitor, not a famous athlete, but able to
hold his own in any field of endeavour. Just before the
Christmas holidays, Warde discovered, to his horror, that
the drainage at the Manor was out of order. At great
expense a new and perfect system was laid down. At last
Warde told himself his house might be pronounced sanitary
within and without.</p>

<p>When the summer term came, Desmond joined John in
the Sixth Form. They were entitled to single rooms, but
they asked and obtained permission to remain in No. 7.
Desmond was invested with the right to fag, and the right
to "find." How blessed a privilege the right to find is,
boys who have enjoyed it will attest. The cosy meals in
one's own room, the pleasant talk, the sense of intimacy,
the freedom from restraint. Custom stales all good things,
but how delicious they taste at first!</p>

<p>The privilege of fagging is not, however, unadulterated
bliss. When Warde said to C&aelig;sar, "Well, Desmond, how
do you like ordering about your slave?" Desmond replied,
ruefully, "Well, sir, little Duff has broken my inkstand, spilt
the ink on our new carpet, and let Verney's bullfinch escape.
I think, on the whole, I'd as lief wait on myself."</p>

<p>Early in June it became plain that unless the unforeseen
occurred, Harrow would have a strong Eleven, and that
Desmond would be a member of it. John and Fluff were
playing in the Sixth Form game; but John had no chance
of his Flannels, although he had improved in batting and
bowling, thanks to Warde's indefatigable coaching. Scaife
hardly ever spoke to John now, but occasionally he came
into No. 7 to talk to Desmond. Upon these rare occasions
John would generally find an excuse for leaving the room.
Always, when he returned, Desmond seemed to be restless
and perplexed. His admiration for Scaife had waxed
rather than waned. Indeed, John himself, detesting Scaife&mdash;for
it had come to that&mdash;fearing him on Desmond's<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
account, admired him notwithstanding: captivated by his
amazing grace, good looks, and audacity. His recklessness
held even the "Bloods" spellbound. A coach ran through
Harrow in the afternoons of that season. Scaife made a
bet that he would drive this coach from one end of the
High Street to the other, under the very nose of Authority.
The rules of the school set forth rigorously that no boy is to
drive in or on any vehicle whatever. Only the Cycle Corps
are allowed to use bicycles. Scaife's bet, you may be sure,
excited extraordinary interest. He won it easily, disguised
as the coachman&mdash;a make-up clever enough to deceive
even those who were in the secret. His friends knew that
he kept two polo-ponies at Wembley. One afternoon he
dared to play in a match against the Nondescripts. Warde's
daughter, just out of the schoolroom, happened to be
present, and she rubbed her lovely eyes when she saw Scaife
careering over the field. Scaife laughed when he saw her;
but before she left the ground a note had reached her.</p>

<div class="lett1"><p>"<span class="smcap">Dear Miss Warde</span>,</p>

<p>"I am sure that you have too much sporting
blood in your veins to tell your father that you have seen
me playing polo.</p>

<p class="author">"Yours very sincerely,<br />
<span style="margin-left: 7em;">"<span class="smcap">Reginald Scaife.</span>"</span></p></div>

<p>To run such risks seemed to John madness; to Desmond
it indicated genius.</p>

<p>"There never was such a fellow," said C&aelig;sar to John.</p>

<p>When C&aelig;sar spoke in that tone John knew that Scaife
had but to hold up a finger, and that C&aelig;sar would come to
him even as a bird drops into the jaws of a snake. C&aelig;sar
was strong, but the Demon was stronger.</p>

<p>After the Zingari Match, Desmond got his Flannels.
He was cheered at six Bill. Everybody liked him; everybody
was proud of him, proud of his father, proud of the
long line of Desmonds, all distinguished, good-looking, and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
with charming manners. The School roared its satisfaction.
John stood a little back, by the cloisters. C&aelig;sar ran past
him, down the steps and into the street, hat in hand,
blushing like a girl. John felt a lump in his throat. He
thrilled because glory shone about his friend; but the
poignant reflection came, that C&aelig;sar was running swiftly,
out of the Yard and out of his own life. And before lock-up
he saw, what he had seen in fancy a thousand times, C&aelig;sar
arm-in-arm with Scaife and the Captain of the Eleven,
C&aelig;sar in his new straw,<a name="FNanchor_33_33" id="FNanchor_33_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_33" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> looking happier than John had
ever seen him, C&aelig;sar, the "Blood," rolling triumphantly
down the High Street, the envied of all beholders, the hero
of the hour.</p>

<p>John called himself a selfish beast, because he had
wished for one terrible moment, wished with heart and soul,
that C&aelig;sar was unpopular and obscure.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Until the</span> Metropolitan Railway joined Harrow to Baker
Street, the Hill stood in the midst of genuine and unspoilt
country, separated by five miles of grass from the nearest
point of the metropolis, and encompassed by isolated
dwellings, ranging in rank and scale from villas to country
houses.<a name="FNanchor_34_34" id="FNanchor_34_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_34" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> Most of the latter have fallen victims to the
speculative builder, and have been cut up into alleys of
brick and stucco. But one or two still remain among their
hayfields and rhododendrons.</p>

<p>John Verney had an eager curiosity, not common in
schoolboys, to know something about the countryside in
which he dwelt. As a Lower Boy, whenever released from
"Compulsory" and House-games, he used to wander with
alert eyes and ears up and down the green lanes of Roxeth
and Harrow Weald, enjoying fresh glimpses of the far-seen
Spire, making friends with cottagers, picking up traditions
of an older and more lawless<a name="FNanchor_35_35" id="FNanchor_35_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_35" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> epoch, and, with these, an<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span>
ever-increasing love and loyalty to Harrow. So Byron had
wandered a hundred years before.</p>

<p>These solitary rambles, however, were regarded with
disfavour by schoolfellows who lacked John's imaginative
temperament. The Caterpillar, for instance, protested,
"Did I see you hobnobbing with a chaw the other day? I
thought so; and you looked like a confounded bughunter."
The Duffer's notions of topography were bounded by the
cricket-ground on the one side of the Hill, and the footer-fields
on the other; and his traditions held nothing much
more romantic than A. J. Webbe's scores at Lord's. Fluff,
as has been said, was too far removed from John to make
him more than an occasional companion. And so, for
several terms, John, for the most part, walked alone. By
the time Desmond joined him, he had gleaned a knowledge
which fascinated a friend of like sensibility and imagination.
Together they revisited the old and explored the new. One
never-to-be-forgotten day the boys discovered a deserted
house of some pretensions about a mile from the Hill. Its
grounds, covering several acres, were enclosed by a high oak
paling, within which stood a thick belt of trees, effectually
concealing what lay beyond. Grim iron gates, always
locked, frowned upon the wayfarer; but John, flattening
an inquisitive nose against the ironwork, could discern a
carriage-drive overgrown with grass and weeds, and at the
end of it a white stone portico. After this the place became
to both boys a sort of Enchanted Castle. A dozen times
they peered through the gates. No one went in or out of
the grass-grown drive. The gatekeeper's lodge was uninhabited;
there were no adjacent cottages where information
might be sought. The boys called it "The Haunted
House," and peopled it with ghosts; gorgeous bucks of the
Regency, languishing beauties such as Lawrence painted,
fiery politicians, duellists, mysterious black-a-vised
foreigners. John connected it in fancy with the days when
the gorgeous Duke of Chandos (who had Handel for his
chapel-organist and was a Governor of Harrow and<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
guardian of Lord Rodney) kept court at Cannons. He told
C&aelig;sar anecdotes of Dr. Parr, with his preposterous wig,
his clouds of tobacco, his sesquipedalian quotations, coming
down from Stanmore; and also of the great Lord Abercorn,
another Governor of the school, who used to go out shooting
in the blue riband of the Garter, and who entertained Pitt
and Sir Walter Scott at Bentley Priory.</p>

<p>"What a lot you know!" said C&aelig;sar. "And you have
a memory like my father's. I'm beginning to think,
Jonathan, that you'll be a swell like him some day&mdash;in the
Cabinet, perhaps."</p>

<p>"Ah," said John, with shining eyes.</p>

<p>"I hope I shall live to see it," Desmond added, with
feeling.</p>

<p>"Thanks, old chap. A crust or a triumph shared with
a pal tastes twice as good."</p>

<p>One soft afternoon in spring, after four Bill, Desmond and
John were approaching the iron gates of the Haunted House.
They had not taken this particular walk since the day when
Desmond got his Flannels. During the winter term, Scaife
and Desmond became members of the Football Eleven.
During this term Scaife won the hundred yards and quarter-mile;
Desmond won the half-mile and mile. In a word,
they had done, from the athletic point of view, nearly all
that could be done. A glorious victory at Lord's seemed
assured. Scaife, Captain and epitome of the brains and
muscles of the Eleven, had grown into a powerful man, with
the mind, the tastes, the passions of manhood. Desmond, on
the other hand, while nearly as tall (and much handsomer
in John's eyes), still retained the look of youth. Indeed, he
looked younger than John, although a year his senior; and
John knew himself to be the elder and wiser, knew that
Desmond leaned upon him whenever a crutch was wanted.</p>

<p>The chief difficulty which besets a school friendship
between two boys is that of being alone together. In Form,
in the playing-fields, in the boarding-house, life is public.
Even in the most secluded lane, a Harrow boy is not secure<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
against the unwelcome salutations of heated athletes who
have been taking a cross-country run, or leaping over, or
into, the Pinner brook. To John the need of sanctuary
had become pressing.</p>

<p>Upon this blessed spring afternoon&mdash;ever afterwards
recalled with special affection&mdash;a retreat was suddenly
provided. As the boys jumped over the last stile into the
lane which led to the Haunted House, Desmond exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"By Jove, the gates are open!"</p>

<p>Then they saw that a man, a sort of caretaker, was in the
act of shutting them.</p>

<p>"May we go in?" John asked civilly.</p>

<p>The man hesitated, eyeing the boys. Desmond's smile
melted him, as it would have melted a mummy.</p>

<p>"There's nothing to see," he said.</p>

<p>Then, in answer to a few eager questions, he told the
story of the Haunted House; haunted, indeed, by the ghosts
of what might have been. A city magnate owned the place.
He had bought it because he wished to educate his only son
at Harrow as a "Home-Boarder," or day-boy. A few weeks
before the boy should have joined the school, he fell ill with
diphtheria, and died. The mother, who nursed him, caught
the disease and died also. The father, left alone, turned his
back upon a place he loathed, resolving to hold it till
building-values increased, but never to set eyes on it again.
The caretaker and his wife occupied a couple of rooms in
the house.</p>

<p>The boys glanced at the house, a common-place mansion,
and began to explore the gardens. To their delight they
found in the shrubberies, now a wilderness of laurel and
rhododendron, a tower&mdash;what our forefathers called a
"Gazebo," and their neighbours a "Folly." The top of it
commanded a wide, unbroken view&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Of all the lowland western lea,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Uxbridge flats and meadows,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">To where the Ruislip waters see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Oxhey lights and shadows."<br /></span>
</div></div>
</div>

<p><span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>"There's the Spire," said John.</p>

<p>The man, who had joined them, nodded. "Yes," said
he, "and my mistress and her boy are buried underneath it.
She wanted him to be there&mdash;at the school, I mean&mdash;and
there he is."</p>

<p>"We're very much obliged to you," said Desmond. He
slipped a shilling into the man's hand, and added, "May
we stay here for a bit? and perhaps we might come again&mdash;eh?"</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir," the man replied, touching his hat.
"Come whenever you like, sir. The gates ain't really
locked. I'll show you the trick of opening 'em when you
come down."</p>

<p>He descended the steep flight of steps after the boys
had thanked him.</p>

<p>"Sad story," said John, staring at the distant Spire.</p>

<p>Desmond hesitated. At times he revealed (to John
alone) a curious melancholy.</p>

<p>"Sad," he repeated. "I don't know about that. Sad
for the father, of course, but perhaps the son is well out of
it. Don't look so amazed, Jonathan. Most fellows seem
to make awful muddles of their lives. You won't, of
course. I see you on pinnacles, but I&mdash;&mdash;" He broke
off with a mirthless laugh.</p>

<p>John waited. The air about them was soft and moist
after a recent shower. The south-west wind stirred the
pulses. Earth was once more tumid, about to bring forth.
Already the hedges were green under the brown; bulbs were
pushing delicate spears through the sweet-smelling soil; the
buds upon a clump of fine beeches had begun to open. In
this solitude, alone with teeming nature, John tried to
interpret his friend's mood; but the spirit of melancholy
eluded him, as if it were a will-o'-the-wisp dancing over an
impassable marsh. Suddenly, there came to him, as there
had come to the quicker imagination of his friend, the overpowering
mystery of Spring, the sense of inevitable change,
the impossibility of arresting it. At the moment all things<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
seemed unsubstantial. Even the familiar Spire, powdered
with gold by the slanting rays of the sun, appeared thinly
transparent against the rosy mists behind it. The Hill, the
solid Hill, rose out of the valley, a lavender-coloured shade
upon the horizon.</p>

<p>"He came here," continued Desmond, dreamily&mdash;John
guessed that he was speaking of the father&mdash;"a rich,
prosperous man. I dare say he worked like a slave in the
city. And he wanted peace and quiet after the Stock
Exchange. Who wouldn't? And he planted out these
gardens, thinking that every plant would grow up and
thrive, and his son with them. And then the boy died;
and the wife followed; and the enchanted castle became
a place of horror; and now it is a wilderness. Haunted?
I should think it was&mdash;haunted! I wish we'd never set
foot in it. There's a curse on it."</p>

<p>"Let's go," said John.</p>

<p>"Too late. We'll stay now, and we'll come again, every
Sunday. Wild and desolate as things look, they will be
lovely when we get back in summer. Don't talk. I'm
going to light a pipe."</p>

<p>Through the circling cloud of tobacco-smoke John stared
at the face which had illumined nearly every hour of his
school-life. Its peculiar vividness always amazed John, the
vitality of it, and yet the perfect delicacy. Scaife's handsome
features were full of vitality also, but coarseness underlay
their bold lines and peered out of the keen, flashing eyes.
When the Caterpillar left Harrow he had said to John&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-bye, Jonathan. Awful rot your going to such
a hole as Oxford! One has had quite enough schooling
after five years here. It's settled I'm going into the Guards.
My father tells me that old Scaife tried to get the Demon
down on the Duke's list. But we don't fancy the Scaife
brand."</p>

<p>Often and often John wondered whether Desmond saw
the brand as plainly as the Caterpillar and he did. Sometimes
he felt almost sure that a word, a look, a gesture<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span>
betraying the bounder, had revolted Desmond; but a few
hours later the bounder bounded into favour again, captivating
eye and heart by some brilliant feat. And then his
brains! He was so diabolically clever. John could always
recall his face as he lay back in the chair in No. 15, sick,
bruised, befuddled, and yet even in that moment of extreme
prostration able to "play the game," as he put it, to defeat
house-master and doctor by sheer strength of will and
intellect. It was Scaife who had persuaded Desmond to
smoke.... C&aelig;sar's voice broke in upon these meditations.</p>

<p>"I say&mdash;what are you frowning about?"</p>

<p>John, very red, replied nervously, "Now that you're
in the Sixth, you ought to chuck smoking."</p>

<p>"What rot!" said C&aelig;sar. "And here, in this tower,
where one couldn't possibly be nailed&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That's it," said John. "It's just because you can't
possibly be nailed that it seems to me not quite square."</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar burst out laughing. "Jonathan, you <i>are</i> a rum
'un. Anyway&mdash;here goes!"</p>

<p>As he spoke he flung the pipe into the bushes below.</p>

<p>"Thanks," said John, quietly.</p>

<p>"We'll come here again. I like this old tower."</p>

<p>"You won't come here without me?"</p>

<p>"Oh, ho! I'm not to let the Demon into our paradise&mdash;eh?
What a jealous old bird you are! Well, I like you
to be jealous." And he laughed again.</p>

<p>"I am jealous," said John, slowly.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The School broke up on the following Tuesday, and
Desmond went home with John.</p>

<p>This happened to be the first time that the friends had
spent Easter together. John wondered whether C&aelig;sar
would take the Sacrament with his mother and him. He
and C&aelig;sar had been confirmed side by side in the Chapel at
Harrow. He felt sure that Desmond would not refuse if he
were asked. On Easter Eve, Mrs. Verney said, in her quiet,
persuasive voice<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>&mdash;</p>

<p>"You will join us to-morrow morning, Harry?"</p>

<p>Desmond flushed, and said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Not remembering his own mother, who had died when
he was a child, he often told John that he felt like a son to
Mrs. Verney. Upon Easter morning, the three met in the
hall, and Desmond asked for a Prayer-book.</p>

<p>"I've lost mine," he murmured.</p>

<p>That afternoon, when they were alone upon the splendid
moor above Stoneycross, Desmond said suddenly&mdash;</p>

<p>"Religion means a lot to you, Jonathan, doesn't it?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"But you never talk about it."</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"Why not?"</p>

<p>"I don't know how to begin."</p>

<p>"There's such sickening hypocrisy in this world."</p>

<p>John nodded.</p>

<p>"But your religion is a help to you, eh? Keeps you
straight?"</p>

<p>John nodded again. Then Desmond said with an air of
finality&mdash;</p>

<p>"I wish I'd some of your faith. I want it badly."</p>

<p>"If you want it badly, you will get it."</p>

<p>A long silence succeeded. Then Desmond exclaimed&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hullo! By Jove, there's a fox, a splendid fellow!
He's come up here amongst the rabbits for a Sunday
dinner. Gone awa-a-a-ay!"</p>

<p>He put his hand to his mouth and halloaed. A minute
later he was talking of hunting. Religion was not mentioned
till they were approaching the house for tea. On
the threshold, Desmond said with a nervous laugh&mdash;</p>

<p>"I'd like your mother to give me a Prayer-book&mdash;a
small one, nothing expensive."</p>

<p>During the following week they hunted with foxhounds
or staghounds every day, except Wednesday.
In the New Forest the Easter hunting is unique. Tremendous
fellows come down from the shires&mdash;masters of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
famous packs, thrusters, keen to see May foxes killed.
And the Forest entertains them handsomely, you may be
sure. Big hampers are unpacked under the oaks which
may have been saplings when William Rufus ruled in
England; there are dinners, and, of course, a hunt-ball in
the ancient village of Lyndhurst. But as each pleasant
day passed, John told himself that the end was drawing
near. This was almost the last holidays C&aelig;sar and he
would spend together; and, afterwards, would this friendship,
so romantic a passion with one at least of them&mdash;would
it wither away, or would it endure to the end?</p>

<p>At the end of a fortnight, Desmond returned to Eaton
Square. Upon the eve of departure, Mrs. Verney gave
him a small Prayer-book.</p>

<p>"I have written something in it," she said; "but
don't open it now."</p>

<p>He looked at the fly-leaf as the train rolled out of
Lyndhurst Station. Upon it, in Mrs. Verney's delicate
handwriting, were a few lines. First his name and the
date. Below, a text&mdash;"Unto whomsoever much is given,
of him shall be much required." And, below that again, a
verse&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Not thankful when it pleaseth me,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">As if Thy blessings had spare days:<br /></span>
<span class="i0">But such a heart whose pulse may be&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i6">Thy praise."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>Desmond stared at the graceful writing long after the
train had passed Totton. "Am I ungrateful?" he asked
himself. "Not to them," he muttered; "surely not to
them." He recalled what Warde had said about ingratitude
being the unpardonable sin. Ah! it was loathsome,
ingratitude! And much had been given to him. How
much? For the first time he made, so to speak, an inventory
of what he had received&mdash;his innumerable blessings.
<i>What had he given in return?</i> And now the fine handwriting
seemed blurred; he saw it through tears which he
ought to have shed. "Oh, my God," he murmured, "am<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
I ungrateful?" The question bit deeper into his mind,
sinking from there into his soul.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When the School reassembled, a curious incident
occurred. John happened to be going up the fine flight of
steps that leads to the Old Schools. He was carrying some
books and papers. Scaife, running down the steps, charged
into him. By great good fortune, no damage was done
except to a nicely-bound Sophocles. John, however, felt
assured that Scaife had deliberately intended to knock him
down, seized, possibly, by an ecstasy of blind rage not
uncommon with him. Scaife smiled derisively, and said&mdash;</p>

<p>"A thousand apologies, Verney."</p>

<p>"<i>One</i> is enough," John replied, "if it is sincere."</p>

<p>They eyed each other steadily. John read a furious
challenge in Scaife's bold eyes&mdash;more, a menace, the
threatening frown of power thwarted. Scaife seemed to
expand, to fill the horizon, to blot out the glad sunshine.
Once again the curious certainty gripped the younger that
Scaife was indeed the personification of evil, the more
malefic because it stalked abroad masked. For Scaife had
outlived his reputation as a breaker of the law. Since that
terrible experience in the Fourth Form Room, he had paid
tithe of mint and cummin. As a Sixth Form boy he upheld
authority, laughing the while in his sleeve. He knew, of
course, that one mistake, one slip, would be fatal. And he
prided himself on not making mistakes. He gambled, but
not with boys; he drank, not with boys; he denied his
body nothing it craved; but he never forgot that expulsion
from Harrow meant the loss of a commission in a smart
cavalry regiment. When it was intimated to him that the
Guards did not want his father's son, he laughed bitterly,
and swore to himself that he would show the stuck-up snobs
what a soldier they had turned away. A soldier he fully
intended to be&mdash;a dashing cavalry leader, if the Fates were
kind. His luck would stand by him; if not&mdash;why&mdash;what
was life without luck? He had never been a reader, but<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
he read now the lives of soldiers. Murat, Uxbridge,
Cardigan, Hodson, were his heroes. Talking of their
achievements, he inflamed his own mind and Desmond's.</p>

<p>The pleasant summer days passed. May melted into
June. And each Sunday John and Desmond walked to the
Haunted House, ascended the tower, and talked. Scaife
was leaving at the end of the summer. Desmond was
staying on for the winter term; then John would have him
entirely to himself. This thought illumined dark hours,
when he saw his friend whirled away by Scaife, transported,
as it were, by the irresistible power of the man of action.
That nothing should be wanting to that trebly-fortunate
youth, he had helped to win the Public Schools' Racquets
Championship. The Manor was now the crack house&mdash;cock-house
at racquets and football, certain to be cock-house
at cricket. And Scaife got most of the credit, not
Warde, who smiled more than ever, and talked continually
of Balliol Scholarships. He never bragged of victories past.</p>

<p>Meantime, John was devoting all energies to the competition
for the Prize Essay. The Head Master had propounded
as theme: "The History and Influence of Parliamentary
Oratory." Bit by bit, John read or declaimed it
to Desmond. Then, according to custom, Desmond copied
it out for his friend. Signed "<i>Spero Infestis</i>," with a sealed
envelope containing John's name inside and the motto
outside, the MS. was placed in the Head Master's letter-box.
John, cooling rapidly after the fever of composition, condemned
his stuff as hopelessly bad; C&aelig;sar went about
telling everybody that Jonathan would win easily, "with a
bit to spare." John did win, but that proved to be the
least part of his triumph. The Essay had to be declaimed
upon Speech Day. Once more John experienced the pangs
that had twisted him at the concert, long ago, when he had
sung to the Nation's hero. And as before, he began weakly.
Then, the fire seizing him, self-consciousness was exorcised
by feeling, and forgetful of the hundreds of faces about him,
he burst into genuine oratory. Thrilled himself, he thrilled<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[184]</a></span>
others. His voice faltered again, but with an emotion that
found an echo in the hearts of his audience; his hand shook,
feeling the pulse of old and young in front of him. Dominated,
swept away by his theme, he dominated others.
When he finished, in the silence that preceded the roar of
applause, he knew that he had triumphed, for he saw
Desmond's glowing countenance, radiant with pleasure,
transfigured by amazement and admiration. Next day a
great newspaper hailed the Harrow boy as one destined to
delight and to lead, perhaps, an all-conquering party in
the House of Commons. And yet, warmed to the core by
this praise, John counted it as nothing compared with his
mother's smile and Desmond's fervent grip.</p>

<p>Fortune, however, comes to no man&mdash;or boy&mdash;with both
hands full. Immediately after Speech Day, John's bubble
of pride and happiness was pricked by Scaife. Midsummer
madness seized the Demon. One may conceive that the
innate recklessness of his nature, suppressed by an iron will,
and smouldering throughout many months, burst at last
into flame. Desmond told John that the Demon had
spent a riotous night in town. He had slipped out of the
Manor after prayers, had driven up to a certain club in
Regent Street, returned in time for first school, fresh as
paint&mdash;so Desmond said&mdash;and then, not content with such
an achievement, must needs brag of it to Desmond.</p>

<p>"And if he's nailed, Eton wins," concluded Desmond.
"I've told you, because together we must put a stop to
such larks."</p>

<p>John slightly raised his thick eyebrows. It was curious
that C&aelig;sar always chose to ignore the hatred which he must
have known to exist between his two friends. Or did he
fatuously believe that, because John exercised an influence
over himself, the same influence would or could be exercised
over Scaife?</p>

<p>"We?" said John.</p>

<p>"I've tried and failed. But together, I say&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"I shan't interfere, C&aelig;sar."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span></p>

<p>"Jonathan, you must."</p>

<p>"It would be a fool's errand."</p>

<p>"We three have gone up the School together. You have
never been fair to Scaife. I tell you he's sound at core.
Why, after he was swished&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Desmond told John what had passed; John shook his
head. He could understand better than any one else why
Scaife had broken down.</p>

<p>"He has splendid ambitions," pursued Desmond.
"He's going to be a great soldier, you see. He thinks of
nothing else. You never have liked him, but because of
that I thought you would do what you could."</p>

<p>The disappointment and chagrin in his voice shook
John's resolution.</p>

<p>"To please you, I'll try."</p>

<p>And accordingly the absurd experiment was made.
Afterwards, John asked himself a thousand times why he
had not foreseen the inevitable result. But the explanation
is almost too simple to be recorded: he wished to convince
a friend that he would attempt anything to prove his
friendship.</p>

<p>That night they went together to Scaife's room. The
second-best room in the Manor, situated upon the first floor,
it overlooked the back of the garden, where there was a
tangled thicket of laurustinus and rhododendron. Scaife
had spent much money in making this room as comfortable
as possible. It had the appearance of a man's room, and
presented all the characteristics of the man who lived in it.
Everything connected with Scaife's triumphal march
through the School was preserved. On the walls were his
caps, fezes, and cups. You could hardly see the paper for
the framed photographs of Scaife and his fellow "bloods."
Scaife as cricketer, Scaife as football-player, Scaife as
racquet-player and athlete, stared boldly and triumphantly
at you. He had a fine desk covered with massive silver
ornaments. Upon this, as upon everything else in the
room, was the hall-mark of the successful man of business.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span>
The papers, the pens and pencils, the filed bills and letters,
the books of reference, spoke eloquently of a mind that used
order as a means to a definite end. All his books were well
bound. His boots were on trees. His racquets were in
their press. Had you opened his chest of drawers, you
would have found his clothes in perfect condition. Obviously,
to an observant eye, the owner of this room gave his
mind to details, because he realized that on details hang
great and successful enterprises.</p>

<p>Scaife stared at John, but welcomed him civilly enough.
Cricket, of course, explained this unexpected visit. As
Desmond blurted out what was in his mind, Scaife frowned;
then he laughed unpleasantly.</p>

<p>"And so I told Jonathan," concluded Desmond.</p>

<p>"So you told Jonathan," repeated Scaife. "Are you
in the habit of telling Jonathan,"&mdash;the derisive inflection as
he pronounced the name warned John at least that he had
much better have stayed away&mdash;"things which concern
others and which don't concern him?"</p>

<p>"If you're going to take it like that&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Keep cool, C&aelig;sar. I'll admit that you mean well.
I should like to hear what Verney has to say."</p>

<p>At that John spoke&mdash;haltingly. Fluent speech upon
any subject very dear to him had always been difficult. He
could talk glibly enough about ordinary topics; his sense
of humour, his retentive memory, made him welcome even
in the critical society of Eaton Square, but you know him
as a creature of unplumbed reserves. The matter in hand
was so vital that he could not touch it with firm hands or
voice. He spoke at his worst, and he knew it; concluding
an incoherent and slightly inarticulate recital of the reasons
which ought to keep Scaife in his house at night with a
lame "Two heads ought to prevail against one."</p>

<p>Scaife showed his fine teeth. "You think that? Your
head and C&aelig;sar's against mine?"</p>

<p>The challenge revealed itself in the derisive, sneering
tone.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span></p>

<p>John shrugged his shoulders and rose. "I have blundered;
I am sorry."</p>

<p>"Hold hard," said Scaife. He read censure upon
Desmond's ingenuous countenance. Then his temper
whipped him to a furious resentment against John, as an
enemy who had turned the tables with good breeding; who
had gained, indeed, a victory against odds. Scaife drew in
his breath; his brows met in a frown. "You have not
blundered; and you are not sorry," he said deliberately.
"I'm not a fool, Verney; but perhaps I have underrated
your ability. You're as clever as they make 'em. You
knew well enough that you were the last person in the world
to lead me in a string; you knew that, I say, and yet you
come here to pose as the righteous youth, doing his duty&mdash;eh?&mdash;against
odds, and accepting credit for the same from
C&aelig;sar. Why, it's plain to me as the nose upon your face
that in your heart you would like me to be sacked."</p>

<p>Desmond interrupted. "You are mad, Demon. Take
that back; take it back!"</p>

<p>"Ask him," said Scaife. "He hates me, and common
decency ought to have kept him out of this room. But he's
not a liar. Ask him. Put it your own way. Soften it,
make pap of it, if you like, but get an answer."</p>

<p>"Jonathan, it is not true, is it? You don't like Scaife;
but you would be sorry, very sorry, to see him&mdash;sacked."</p>

<p>"I'm glad you've not funked it," said Scaife. "You've
put it squarely. Let him answer it as squarely."</p>

<p>John was white to the lips, white and trembling; despicable
in his own eyes, how much more despicable,
therefore, in the eyes of his friend, whose passionate faith
in him was about to be scorched and shrivelled.</p>

<p>Scaife began to laugh.</p>

<p>"For God's sake, don't laugh!" said Desmond. "Jonathan,
I know you are too proud to defend yourself against
such an abominable charge."</p>

<p>"He's not a liar," said Scaife.</p>

<p>"It's true," said John, in a strangled voice.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span></p>

<p>"You have wished that he might be sacked?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>John met Desmond's indignant eyes with an expression
which the other was too impetuous, too inexperienced to
interpret. Into that look of passionate reproach he flung
all that must be left unsaid, all that Scaife could read as
easily as if it were scored in letters of flame. Because, in
his modesty and humility, he had ever reckoned that Scaife
would prevail against himself&mdash;because, with unerring
instinct, he had apprehended, as few boys could apprehend,
the issues involved, he had desired, fervently desired, that
Scaife should be swept from C&aelig;sar's path. But this he
could not plead as an excuse to his friend; and Scaife had
known that, and had used his knowledge with fiendish
success. John lowered his eyes and walked from the room.</p>

<p>When he met Desmond again, nothing was said on either
side. John told himself that he would speak, if Desmond
spoke first. But evidently Desmond had determined
already the nature of their future relations. They no longer
shared No. 7, John being in the Upper Sixth with a room
to himself, but they still "found" together. To separate
would mean a public scandal from which each shrank in
horror. No; let them meet at meals as before till the end
of the term. Indeed, so little change was made in their
previous intercourse, that John began to hope that C&aelig;sar
would walk with him as usual upon the following Sunday.
And if he did&mdash;if he did, John felt that he would speak.
On the top of the tower, looking towards the Spire, alone
with his friend, exalted above the thorns and brambles of
the wilderness, words would come to him.</p>

<p>But on the following Sunday Desmond walked with Scaife.</p>

<span class="i0">"There we sat in the circle vast,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Hard by the tents, from noon,<br /></span>

</div></div></div>


<p>"<span class="smcap">My dear</span> Jonathan, I'm delighted to see you. You know
my father, I think?" It was the Caterpillar that spoke.</p>

<p>John shook hands with Colonel Egerton.</p>

<p>The three were standing in the Members' Enclosure at
Lord's. The Caterpillar, gorgeous in frock-coat, with three
corn-flowers<a name="FNanchor_36_36" id="FNanchor_36_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_36" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> in the lapel of it, was about as great a buck
as his sire, quite as conspicuous, and, seemingly, as cool.
It happened to be a blazing hot day, but heat seldom
affected Colonel Egerton.</p>

<p>"By Jove," he said to John, "I'm told it's a certainty
this year, and I've come early, too early for me, to see a
glorious victory. There's civil war raging on the top of
the Trent coach, I give you my word."</p>

<p>"We've won the toss," said John.</p>

<p>"Ah, there's Charles Desmond, an early bird, too."</p>

<p>He bustled away, leaving John and the Caterpillar
together. The great ground in front of them was being
cleared. One could see, through the few people scattered
here and there, the wickets pitched in the middle of that
vast expanse of lawn, and the umpires in their long white
coats. Upon the top of the steps, in the middle of the
pavilion, the Eton captain was collecting his Eleven. The<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
Duffer, who had got his Flannels at the last moment, came
up and joined John and the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>"The Manor's well to the front," said the Caterpillar.
"By Jove! I never thought to see Fluff in the Eleven."</p>

<p>"Fluff came on tremendously this term," the Duffer
replied.</p>

<p>"Of course the Kinlochs are a cricketing family."</p>

<p>"Good joke the brothers playing against each other,"
said John.</p>

<p>"Warde," the Duffer nodded in the direction of Warde,
who was talking with Charles Desmond and Colonel Egerton,
"has worked like a slave. He made a cricketer out
of Fluff and a scholar out of Jonathan. He's so mad keen
to see us win, that he's given me the jumps."</p>

<p>"You must keep cool," the Caterpillar murmured.
"I've just come from the Trent coach. Fluff has it from
the brother who is playing that the Eton bowling is weak.
But Strathpeffer, the eldest son, tells me the batsmen are
stronger than last year. He seemed anxious to bet; so
we have a fiver about it. They're taking the field."</p>

<p>The Eton Eleven walked towards the wicket, loudly
cheered. C&aelig;sar came up in his pads, carrying his bat and
gloves. He shook hands with the Caterpillar, and said,
with a groan, that he had to take the first ball.</p>

<p>"Keep cool," said the Caterpillar. "The bowling's
weak; I have it from Cosmo Kinloch. They're in a
precious funk."</p>

<p>"So am I," said the Duffer.</p>

<p>"But you're a bowler," said Desmond. "If I get out
first ball, I shall cut my throat."</p>

<p>But C&aelig;sar looked alert, cool, and neither under- nor
over-confident.</p>

<p>"You'll cut the ball, not your throat," said the Duffer.
Cutting was C&aelig;sar's strong point.</p>

<p>The Caterpillar nodded, and spoke oracularly&mdash;</p>

<p>"My governor says he never shoots at a snipe without
muttering to himself, 'Snipe on toast.' It steadies his<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
nerves. When you see the ball leave the bowler's hand,
you say to yourself, 'Eton on toast.'"</p>

<p>"Your own, Caterpillar?"</p>

<p>"My own," said the Caterpillar, modestly. "I don't
often make a joke, but that's mine. Pass it on."</p>

<p>The other Harrovian about to go in beckoned to Desmond.</p>

<p>"C&aelig;sar won't be bowled first ball," said the Caterpillar.
"He's the sort that rises to an emergency. Can't we find
a seat?"</p>

<p>They sat down and watched the Eton captain placing
his field. Desmond and his companion were walking
slowly towards the wickets amid Harrow cheers. The
cheering was lukewarm as yet. It would have fire enough
in it presently. The Caterpillar pointed out some of the
swells.</p>

<p>"That's old Lyburn. Hasn't missed a match since '64.
Was brought here once with a broken leg! Carried in a
litter, by Jove! That fellow with the long, white beard is
Lord Fawley. He made 78 <i>not out</i> in the days of Charlemagne."</p>

<p>"It was in '53," said the Duffer, who never joked on
really serious subjects; "and he made 68, not 78. He's
pulling his beard. I believe he's as nervous as I am."</p>

<p>Presently the innumerable voices about them were
hushed; all eyes turned in one direction. Desmond was
about to take the first ball. It was delivered moderately
fast, with a slight break. Desmond played forward.</p>

<p>"Well played, sir! Well pla-a-ayed!"</p>

<p>The shout rumbled round the huge circle. The beginning
and the end of a great match are always thrilling.
The second and third balls were played like the first. John
could hear Mr. Desmond saying to Warde, "He has Hugo's
style and way of standing&mdash;eh?" And Warde replied,
"Yes; but he's a finer batsman. Ah-h-h!"</p>

<p>The first real cheer burst like a bomb. Desmond had
cut the sixth ball to the boundary.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span></p>

<p>Over! The new bowler was a tall, thin boy with flaxen hair.</p>

<p>"That's Cosmo Kinloch, Fluff's brother," said John.
"I wonder they can't do better than that. Even I knocked
him all over the shop at White Ladies last summer."</p>

<p>"He's come on, they tell me," said the Caterpillar.
"Good Lord, he nearly had him first ball."</p>

<p>Fluff's brother bowled slows of a good length, with an
awkward break from the off to the leg.</p>

<p>"Teasers," said the Caterpillar, critically. "Hullo!
No, my young friend, that may do well enough in Shropshire,
not here."</p>

<p>A ball breaking sharply from the off had struck the
batsman's pad; he had stepped in front of his wicket to
cut it. Country umpires are often beguiled by bowlers
into giving wrong decisions in such cases; not so your
London expert. Cosmo Kinloch appealed&mdash;in vain.</p>

<p>"He'll send a short one down now," said John. "You see."</p>

<p>And, sure enough, a long hop came to the off, curling
inwards after it pitched. The Eton captain had nearly all
his men on the off side. The Harrovian pulled the ball
right round to the boundary.</p>

<p>"Well hit!"</p>

<p>"Well pulled!"</p>

<p>"Two 4's; that's a good beginning," said the Duffer.</p>

<p>A couple of singles followed, and then the first "10"
went up amid cheers.</p>

<p>"Here's my governor," said the Duffer. "He was three
years in the Eleven and Captain his last term."</p>

<p>"You've told us that a thousand times," said the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>The Rev. Septimus Duff greeted the boys warmly. His
eyes sparkled out of a cheery, bearded face. Look at him
well. An Harrovian of the Harrovians this. His grandfathers
on the maternal and paternal side had been friends
at Harrow in Byron's time. The Rev. Septimus wore<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
rather a shabby coat and a terrible hat, but the consummate
Caterpillar, who respected pedigrees, regarded him with
pride and veneration. He came up from his obscure West
Country vicarage to town just once a year&mdash;to see the
match. If you asked him, he would tell you quite simply
that he would sooner see the match and his old friends than
go to Palestine; and the Rev. Septimus had yearned to
visit Palestine ever since he left Cambridge; and it is not
likely that this great wish will ever be gratified. He is the
father of three sons, but the Duffer is the first to get into
the Eleven. Charles Desmond joins them. At the moment,
Charles Desmond is supposed to be one of the most
harried men in the Empire. Times are troublous. A war-cloud,
as large as Kruger's hand, has just risen in the
South, and is spreading itself over the whole world. But
to-day the great Minister has left the cares of office in
Downing Street. He hails the Rev. Septimus with a genial
laugh and a hearty grasp of the hand.</p>

<p>"Ah, Sep, upon your word of honour, now&mdash;would you
sooner be here to see the Duffer take half a dozen wickets,
or be down in Somerset, Bishop of Bath and Wells?"</p>

<p>"When <i>you</i> offer me the bishopric," replied the Rev.
Septimus, with a twinkle, "I'll answer that question, my
dear Charles, and not before."</p>

<p>"You old humbug! You're so puffed up with sinful
pride that you've stuck your topper on to your head the
wrong way about."</p>

<p>"Bless my soul," said the Duffer's father, "so I
have."</p>

<p>"That topper of the governor's," the Duffer remarked
solemnly, "has seen twenty-five matches at least."</p>

<p>John looked at no hats; his eyes were on the pitch.
Another round of cheers proclaimed that "20" had gone
up. Both boys are batting steadily; no more boundary
hits; a snick here, a snack there&mdash;and then&mdash;merciful
Heavens!&mdash;C&aelig;sar has cut a curling ball "bang" into short
slip's hands.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span></p>

<p>Short slip&mdash;wretched youth&mdash;muffs it! Derisive remarks
from Rev. Septimus.</p>

<p>"Well caught! Well held! Tha-a-nks!"</p>

<p>The Caterpillar would pronounce this sort of chaff bad
form in a contemporary. He removes his hat.</p>

<p>"By Jove!" says he. "It's very warm."</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar times the next ball beautifully. It glides past
point and under the ropes.</p>

<p>Early as it is, the ground seems to be packed with
people. Glorious weather has allured everybody. Stand
after stand is filled up. The colour becomes kaleidoscopic.
The Rev. Septimus, during the brief interval of an over,
allows his eyes to stray round the huge circle. Upon the
ground are the youth, the beauty, the rank and fashion of
the kingdom, and, best of all, his old friends. The Rev.
Septimus has a weakness, being, of course, human to the
finger-tips. He calls himself a <i>laudator temporis acti</i>. In
his day, the match was less of a function. The boys sat
round upon the grass; behind them were the carriages and
coaches&mdash;you could drive on to the ground then!&mdash;and
here and there, only here and there, a tent or a small stand.
<i>Consule Planco</i>&mdash;the parson loves a Latin tag&mdash;the match
was an immense picnic for Harrovians and Etonians. And,
my word, you ought to have heard the chaff when an
unlucky fielder put the ball on the floor. Or, when a
batsman interposed a pad where a bat ought to have been.
Or, if a player was bowled first ball. Or, if he swaggered
as he walked, the cynosure of all eyes, from the pavilion to
the pitch. Upon this subject the Rev. Septimus will preach
a longer (and a more interesting) sermon than any you will
hear from his pulpit in Blackford-Orcas Church.</p>

<p>Loud cheers put an end to the parson's reminiscences.
Desmond's companion has been clean bowled for a useful
fifteen runs. He walks towards the pavilion slowly. Then,
as he hears the Harrow cheers, he blushes like a nymph of
sixteen, for he counts himself a failure. Last year he made
a "duck" in his first innings, and five in the second. No<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span>
cheers then. This is his first taste of the honey mortals call
success. He has faced the great world, and captured its
applause.</p>

<p>"When does Scaife go in?" the Rev. Septimus asks.</p>

<p>"Second wicket down."</p>

<p>More cheers as the second man in strolls down the steps.
A careful cove, so the Duffer tells his father&mdash;one who will
try to break the back of the bowling.</p>

<p>"They're taking off Fluff's brother," the Caterpillar
observes.</p>

<p>A thick-set young man holds the ball. He makes some
slight alteration in the field. The wicket-keeper stands
back; the slips and point retreat a few yards. The ball
that took the first wicket was the last of an over. Desmond
has to receive the attack of the new bowler.</p>

<p>The thick-set Etonian, having arranged the off side to
his satisfaction, prepares to take a long run. He holds
the ball in the left hand, runs sideways at great speed,
changes the ball from the left hand to the right at the last
moment, and seems to hurl both it and himself at the
batsman.</p>

<p>"Greased lightning!" says John.</p>

<p>A dry summer had made the pitch rather fiery. The
ball, short-pitched, whizzes just over C&aelig;sar's head. A
second and a third seem to graze his cap. Murmurs are
heard. Is the Eton bowler trying to kill or maim his
antagonist? Is he deliberately endeavouring to establish
a paralysing "funk"?</p>

<p>But the fourth ball is a "fizzer"&mdash;the right length, a
bailer, terrifically fast, but just off the wicket. Desmond
snicks it between short slip and third man; it goes to the
boundary.</p>

<p>"That's what C&aelig;sar likes," says the Duffer. "He can
cut behind the wicket till the cows come home."</p>

<p>"Cut&mdash;and come again," says the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>The fifth ball is played forward for a risky single. The
Rev. Septimus forgets that times have changed. And if<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span>
they have, what of it? He hasn't. His deep, vibrant voice
rolls across the lawn right up to the batsman&mdash;</p>

<p>"Steady there! Steady!"</p>

<p>And now the new-comer has to take the last ball of the
over&mdash;his first. Alas and alack! The sixth ball is dead
on to the middle stump. The Harrovian plays forward.
Man alive, you ought to have played back to that! The
ball grazes the top edge of the bat's blade and flies straight
into the welcoming hands of the wicket-keeper.</p>

<p>Two wickets for 33.</p>

<p>Breathless suspense, broken by tumultuous cheers as
Scaife strides on to the ground. His bat is under his arm;
he is drawing on his gloves. Thousands of men and as
many women are staring at his splendid face and figure.</p>

<p>"What a mover!" murmurs the Rev. Septimus.</p>

<p>Scaife strides on. Upon his face is the expression John
knows so well and fears so much&mdash;the consciousness of
power, the stern determination to be first, to shatter previous
records. John can predict&mdash;and does so with absolute
certainty&mdash;what will happen. For six overs the Demon
will treat every ball&mdash;good, bad, and indifferent&mdash;with the
most distinguished consideration. And then, when his
"eye" is in, he will give the Etonians such leather-hunting
as they never had before.</p>

<p>After a long stand made by Scaife and Desmond, C&aelig;sar
is caught at cover-point, but Scaife remains. It is a
Colossus batting, not a Harrow boy. The balls come down
the pitch; the Demon's shoulders and chest widen; the
great knotted arms go up&mdash;crash! First singles; then
twos; then threes; and then boundary after boundary.
To John&mdash;and to how many others?&mdash;Scaife has been
transformed into a tremendous human machine, inexorably
cutting and slicing, pulling and driving&mdash;the embodied
symbol of force, ruthlessly applied, indefatigable,
omnipotent.</p>

<p>The Eton captain, hopeful against odds, puts on a
cunning and cool dealer in "lobs." Fluff is in, playing<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
steadily, holding up his wicket, letting the giant make the
runs. The Etonian delivers his first ball. Scaife leaves the
crease. Fluff sees the ball slowly spinning&mdash;harmless
enough till it pitches, and then deadly as a writhing serpent.
Scaife will not let it pitch. The ball curves slightly from
the leg to the off. Scaife is facing the pavilion&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>A stupendous roar bursts from the crowd. The ball, hit
with terrific force, sails away over the green sward, over the
ropes, over the heads of the spectators, and slap on to the
top of the pavilion.</p>

<p>Only four; but one of the finest swipes ever seen at
Lord's. Shade of Mynn, come forth from the tomb to
applaud that mighty stroke!</p>

<p>But the dealer in lobs knows that the man who leaves
his citadel, leaves it, sooner or later, not to return. In the
hope that Scaife, intoxicated with triumph, will run out
again, he pitches the next lob too much up&mdash;a half-volley.
Scaife smiles.</p>

<p>John's prediction has been fulfilled. A record has been
established. Never before in an Eton and Harrow match
have two balls been hit over the ropes in succession. The
crowds have lost their self-possession. Men, women, and
children are becoming delirious. The Rev. Septimus
throws his ancient topper into the air; the Caterpillar
splits a brand-new pair of delicate grey gloves. Upon the
tops of the coaches, mothers, sisters, aunts, and cousins are
cheering like Fourth-Form boys.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The Harrow first innings closed with 289 runs, Scaife
carrying out his bat for an almost flawless 126. Desmond
made 72; Fluff was in for twenty-seven minutes&mdash;a great
performance for him&mdash;and was caught in the slips after
compiling a useful 17.</p>

<p>But the remarkable feature of the innings was the short
time in which so many runs were made&mdash;exactly three
hours. The elevens went in to lunch, as the crowd poured
over the ground, laughing and chattering. This is a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
delightful hour to the Rev. Septimus. He will walk to the
wickets, and wait there for his innumerable friends. It will
be, "Hullo, Sep!" "By Jove, here's dear old Sep!"
"Sep, you unfriendly beast, why do you never come to see
us?" "Sep, when are you going to send that awful tile
of yours to the British Museum?" And so on.</p>

<p>Twenty men, at least&mdash;some of them with names known
wherever the Union Jack waves&mdash;will ask the Rev. Sep to
lunch with them; but the Rev. Sep will say, as he has said
these thirty years, that he doesn't come to Lord's to
"gorge." A sandwich presently, and a glass of "fizz," if
you please; but time is precious. A tall bishop strolls up&mdash;one
of the pillars of the Church, an eloquent preacher,
and an autocrat in his diocese. Most people regard him
with awe. The Rev. Sep greets him with a scandalous slap
on the back, and addresses him, the apostolic one, as&mdash;Lamper.<a name="FNanchor_37_37" id="FNanchor_37_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_37" class="fnanchor">[37]</a>
And the Lord Bishop of Dudley says, like the
others&mdash;</p>

<p>"Hullo, Sep! We used to think you a slogger, but you
never came anywhere near that smite of Scaife's."</p>

<p>"I thought his smite was coming too near me," says the
Rev. Sep, with a shrewd glance at the pavilion. "Lamper,
old chap, I <i>am</i> glad to see your 'phiz' again."</p>

<p>And so they stroll off together, mighty prelate and
humble country parson, once again happy Harrow boys.</p>

<p>And now, before Eton goes in, we must climb on to the
Trent coach. Fluff and his brother Cosmo, the Eton
bowler, are lunching in other company, but we shall find
Colonel Egerton and the Caterpillar and Warde; so the
Hill slightly outnumbers the Plain, as the duke puts it.
Next to the duchess sits Mrs. Verney. The duke is torn
nearly in two between his desire that Fluff should make
runs and that Cosmo, the Etonian, should take wickets.
His Eton sons regard him as a traitor, a "rat," and Colonel
Egerton gravely offers him the corn-flowers out of his
coat.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span></p>

<p>"You can laugh," the duke says seriously, "but when
I see what Harrow has done for Esm&eacute;, I'm almost sorry"&mdash;he
looks at his youngest son (nearly, but not quite, as
delicate-looking as Fluff used to be)&mdash;"I'm almost sorry
that I didn't send Alastair there also."</p>

<p>Alastair smiles contemptuously. "If you had," he
says, "I should have never spoken to you again. Esm&eacute; is
a forgiving chap, but you've wrecked his life. At least,
that's my opinion."</p>

<p>After luncheon, the crowd on the lawn thickens. The
ladies want to see the pitch, and, shall we add, to display
their wonderful frocks. The enclosure at Ascot on Cup
Day is not so gay and pretty a scene as this. The Caterpillar,
sly dog, has secured Iris Warde, and looks uncommonly
pleased with himself and his companion; a smart
pair, but smart pairs are common as gooseberries. It is
the year of picture hats and Gainsborough dresses.</p>

<p>"England at its best," says Miss Iris.</p>

<p>"And in its best," the Caterpillar replies solemnly.</p>

<p>Iris Warde is as keen as her father's daughter ought to
be. She tells the Caterpillar that when she was a small girl
with only threepence a week pocket-money, she used to
save a penny a week for twelve weeks preceding the match,
so as to be able to put a shilling into the plate on Sunday
<i>if Harrow won</i>.</p>

<p>"And I dare say you'll marry an Etonian and wear light
blue after all," growls the Caterpillar.</p>

<p>"Never!" says Miss Iris.</p>

<p>Now, amongst the black coats in the pavilion you see a
white figure or two. The Elevens have finished lunch, and
are mixing with the crowd. Scaife is talking with a famous
Old Carthusian, one of the finest living exponents of cricket,
sometime an "International" at football, and a D.S.O.
The great man is very cordial, for he sees in Scaife an All-England
player. Scaife listens, smiling. Obviously, he is
impatient to begin again. As soon as possible he collects
his men, and leads them into the field. One can hear the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
policemen saying in loud, firm voices, "Pass along, please;
pass along!" As if by magic the crowds on the lawn melt
away. In a few minutes the Etonians come out of the
pavilion. The sun shines upon their pale-blue caps and
sashes, and upon faces slightly pale also, but not yet blue.
For Eton has a strong batting team, and Scaife and Desmond
have proved that it is a batsman's wicket.</p>

<p>And now the connoisseurs, the really great players,
settle themselves down comfortably to watch Scaife field.
That, to them, is the great attraction, apart from the contest
between the rival schools. Some of these Olympians
have been heard to say that Scaife's innings against weak
bowling was no very meritorious performance, although the
two "swipes," they admit, were parlous knocks. Still,
Public School cricket is kindergarten cricket, and if you've
not been at Eton or Harrow, and if you loathe a fashionable
crowd, and if you think first-class fielding is worth coming
to Lord's to see, why, then, my dear fellow, look at
Scaife!</p>

<p>Scaife stands at cover-point. If you put up your
binoculars, you will see that he is almost on his toes. His
heels are not touching the ground. And he bends slightly,
not quite as low as a sprinter, but so low that he can start
with amazing speed. For two overs not a ball worth
fielding rolls his way. Ah! that will be punished. A long
hop comes down the pitch. The Etonian squares his
shoulders. His eye, to be sure, is on the ball, but in his
mind's eye is the boundary; in his ear the first burst of
applause. Bat meets ball with a smack which echoes from
the Tennis Court to the stands across the ground. Now
watch Scaife! He dashes at top speed for the only point
where his hands may intercept that hard-hit ball. And,
by Heaven! he stops it, and flicks it up to the wicket-keeper,
who whips off the bails.</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>"Not out!"</p>

<p>"Well fielded; well fielded, sir!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[201]</a></span></p>

<p>"A very close squeak," says the Caterpillar. "They
won't steal many runs from the Demon."</p>

<p>"Sometimes," says Iris Warde, "I really think that he
<i>is</i> a demon."</p>

<p>The Caterpillar nods. "You're more than half right,
Miss Warde."</p>

<p>Presently, the first wicket falls; then the second soon
after. And the score is under twenty. The Rev. Septimus
is beaming; the Bishop seated beside him looks as if
he were about to pronounce a benediction; Charles
Desmond is scintillating with wit and good humour.
Visions of a single innings victory engross the minds of these
three. They are in the front row of the pavilion, and
they mean to see every ball of the game.</p>

<p>But soon it becomes evident that a determined stand
is being made. Runs come slowly, but they come; the
score creeps up&mdash;thirty, forty, fifty. Fluff goes on to bowl.
On his day Fluff is tricky, but this, apparently, is not his
day. The runs come more quickly. The Rev. Septimus
removes his hat, wipes his forehead, and replaces his hat.
It is on the back of his head, but he is unaware of that.
The Bishop appears now as if he were reading a new commination&mdash;to
wit, "Cursed is he that smiteth his neighbour;
cursed is he that bowleth half volleys." The Minister is
frowning; things may look black in South Africa, but
they're looking blacker in St. John's Wood.</p>

<p>One hundred runs for two wickets.</p>

<p>The Eton cheers are becoming exasperating. A few
seats away Warde is twiddling his thumbs and biting his
lips. Old Lord Fawley has slipped into the pavilion for a
brandy and soda.</p>

<p>At last!</p>

<p>Scaife takes off Fluff and puts on a fast bowler, changing
his own place in the field to short slip. The ball, a first
ball and very fast, puzzles the batsman, accustomed to
slows. He mistimes it; it grazes the edge of his bat, and
whizzes off far to the right of Scaife, but the Demon has it.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
Somehow or other, ask of the spirits of the air&mdash;not of the
writer&mdash;somehow his wonderful right hand has met and
held the ball.</p>

<p>"Well caught, sir; well caught!"</p>

<p>"That boy ought to be knighted on the spot," says
Charles Desmond. Then the three generously applaud the
retiring batsman. He has played a brilliant innings, and
restored the confidence of all Etonians.</p>

<p>The Eton captain descends the steps; a veteran this,
not a dashing player, but sure, patient, and full of grit.
He asks the umpire to give him middle and leg; then he
notes the positions of the field.</p>

<p>"Whew-w-w-w!"</p>

<p>"D&mdash;&mdash;n it!" ejaculates Charles Desmond. Bishop
and parson regard him with gratitude. There are times
when an honest oath becomes expedient. The Eton captain
has cut the first ball into Fluff's hands, and Fluff has
dropped it! Alastair Kinloch, from the top of the Trent
coach, screams out, "Jolly well muffed!" The great
Minister silently thanks Heaven that point is the Duke's
son and not his.</p>

<p>And, of course, the Eton captain never gives another
chance till he is dismissed with half a century to his credit.
Meantime five more wickets have fallen. Seven down for
191! Eton leaves the field with a score of 226 against
Harrow's 289. Harrow goes in without delay, and one
wicket is taken for 13 runs before the stumps are drawn.
Charles Desmond looks at the sky.</p>

<p>"Looks like rain to-night," he says anxiously.</p>

<p>And so ends Friday's play.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The morrow dawned grey, obscured by mist rising from
ground soaked by two hours' heavy rain. You may be
sure that all our friends were early at Lord's, and that the
pitch was examined by thousands of anxious eyes. The
Eton fast bowler was seen to smile. Upon a similar wicket
had he not done the famous hat-trick only three weeks<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
before? The rain, however, was over, and soon the sun
would drive away the filmy mists. No man alive could
foretell what condition the pitch would be in after a few
hours of blazing sunshine. The Rev. Septimus told Charles
Desmond that he considered the situation to be critical,
and, although he had read the morning paper, he was not
alluding even indirectly to South African affairs. Charles
Desmond said that, other things being equal, the Hill would
triumph; but he admitted that other things were very far
from equal. It looked as if Harrow would have to bat
upon a treacherous wicket, and Eton on a sound one.</p>

<p>At half-past ten punctually the men were in the field.
Scaife issued last instructions. "Block the bowling; don't
try to score till you see what tricks the ground will play.
A minute saved now may mean a quarter of an hour to us
later." C&aelig;sar nodded cheerfully. The fact that the luck
had changed stimulated every fibre of his being. And he
said that he felt in his bones that this was going to be a
famous match, like that of '85&mdash;something never to be
forgotten.</p>

<p>Charles Desmond spoke few words while his son was
batting. It was a tradition among the Desmonds that they
rose superior to emergency. The Minister wondered
whether his Harry would rise or fall. The fast bowler
delivered the first ball. It bumped horribly. The Rev.
Septimus shuddered and closed his eyes. C&aelig;sar got well
over it. The third ball was cut for three. The fourth
whizzed down&mdash;a wide. The fast bowler dipped the ball
into the sawdust.</p>

<p>"It isn't all jam for him," whispered the Rev. Septimus.</p>

<p>"Well bowled&mdash;well bowled!"</p>

<p>Alas! the middle stump was knocked clean out of the
ground. C&aelig;sar's partner, a steady, careful player, had
been bowled by his first ball.</p>

<p>Two wickets for 17.</p>

<p>The crowd were expecting the hero, but Fluff was
walking towards the wickets, wondering whether he should<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span>
reach them alive. Never had his heart beat as at this
moment. Scaife had come up to him as soon as he had
examined the pitch.</p>

<p>"Fluff, I am putting you in early because you are a
fellow I can trust. My first and last word is, hit at nothing
that isn't wide of the wicket. The ground will probably
improve fast."</p>

<p>Fluff nodded. A hive of bees seemed to have lodged in
his head, and an active automatic hammer in his heart;
but he didn't dare tell the Demon that funk, abject funk,
possessed him, body and soul.</p>

<p>The second bowler began his first over. He bowled
slows. Desmond played the six balls back along the
ground. A maiden over.</p>

<p>And then that thick-set, muscular beast, for so Fluff
regarded him, stared fixedly at Fluff's middle stump.
Fluff glanced round. The wicket-keeper had a grim smile
on his lips, for his billet was no easy one. Cosmo Kinloch
at short slip looked as if it were a foregone conclusion that
Fluff would put the ball into his hands. Then Fluff faced
the bowler. Now for it!</p>

<p>The first ball was half a foot off the wicket, but Fluff let
it go by. The second came true enough. Fluff blocked it.
The third flew past Fluff's leg, but he just snicked it. Desmond
started to run, and then stopped, holding up his
hand. Cheers rippled round the ring for the first hit to the
boundary. That was a bit of sheer luck, Fluff reflected.</p>

<p>After this both boys played steadily for some ten minutes.
Then, very slowly, C&aelig;sar began to score. He had
made about fifteen when he drove a ball hard to the on,
Fluff backing up. Desmond, watching the travelling ball,
called to him to run. It seemed to Desmond almost
certain that the ball would go to the boundary. Too late
he realized that it had been magnificently fielded. Desmond
strained every nerve, but his bat had not reached
the crease when the bails flew to right and left.</p>

<p>Out! And run out!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>Three wickets for 41!</p>

<p>A quarter of an hour later Fluff was bowled with a
yorker. He had made eleven runs, and kept up his wicket
during a crisis. Harrow cheered him loudly.</p>

<p>And then came the terrible moment of the morning.
Scaife went in when Fluff's wicket fell. The ground had
improved, but it was still treacherous. The fast bowler
sent down a straight one. It shot under Scaife's bat and
spread-eagled his stumps.</p>

<p>The wicket-keeper knows what the Harrow captain
said, but it does not bear repeating. Every eye was on his
scowling, furious face as he returned to the pavilion; and
the Rev. Septimus scowled also, because he had always
maintained that any Harrovian could accept defeat like a
gentleman. Upon the other side of the ground the Caterpillar
was saying to his father. "I always said he was
hairy at the heel."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>It was admitted afterwards that the Duffer's performance
was the one really bright spot in Harrow's second
innings. Being a bowler, he went in last but one. It
happened that Fluff's brother was in possession of the ball.
It will never be known why the Duffer chose to treat Cosmo
Kinloch's balk with utter scorn and contempt. The Duffer
was tall, strong, and a terrific slogger. Nobody expected
him to make a run, but he made twenty in one over&mdash;all
boundary hits. When he left the wicket he had added
thirty-eight to the score, and wouldn't have changed places
with an emperor. The Rev. Septimus followed him into
the room where the players change.</p>

<p>"My dear boy," he said, "I've never been able to give
you a gold watch, but you must take mine; here it is,
and&mdash;and God bless you!"</p>

<p>But the Duffer swore stoutly that he preferred his own
Waterbury.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Eton went in to make 211 runs in four hours, upon a<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
wicket almost as sound as it had been upon the Friday.
Scaife put the Duffer on to bowl. The Demon had belief
in luck.</p>

<p>"It's your day, Duffer," he said. "Pitch 'em up."</p>

<p>The Duffer, to his sire's exuberant satisfaction, "pitched
'em up" so successfully that he took four wickets for 33.
Four out of five! The other bowlers, however, being not
so successful, Eton accumulated a hundred runs. The
captains had agreed to draw stumps at 7.30. To win,
therefore, the Plain must make another hundred in two
hours; and three of their crack batsmen were out.</p>

<p>After tea an amazing change took place in the temper
of the spectators. Conviction seized them that the finish
was likely to be close and thrilling; that the one thing
worth undivided attention was taking place in the middle
of the ground. As the minutes passed, a curious silence
fell upon the crowd, broken only by the cheers of the rival
schools. The boys, old and young alike, were watching
every ball, every stroke. The Eton captain was still in,
playing steadily, not brilliantly; the Harrow bowling was
getting slack.</p>

<p>In the pavilion, the Rev. Septimus, Warde, and Charles
Desmond were sitting together. Not far from them was
Scaife's father, a big, burly man with a square head and
heavy, strongly-marked features. He had never been a
cricketer, but this game gripped him. He sat next to a
world-famous financier of the great house of Neuchatel,
whose sons had been sent to the Hill. Run after run, run
after run was added to the score. Scaife's father turned
to Neuchatel.</p>

<p>"I'd write a cheque for ten thousand pounds," he said,
"if we could win."</p>

<p>Lionel Neuchatel nodded. "Yes," he muttered; "I
have not felt so excited since Sir Bevis won the Derby."</p>

<p>In the deep field Desmond was standing, miserable
because he had nothing to do. No balls came his way; for
the Eton captain had made up his mind to win this match<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
with singles and twos. Very carefully he placed his balls
between the fielders; very carefully his partner followed
his chief's example. No stealing of runs, no scoring off
straight balls, no gallery play&mdash;till victory was assured.</p>

<p>Poor Lord Fawley retired at this point into an inner
room, pulling savagely at his white beard. Old Lyburn,
who had been sitting beside him, gurgling and gasping,
staggered after him. The Rev. Septimus kept wiping his
forehead.</p>

<p>"I can't stand this much longer," said Warde, in a
hoarse whisper.</p>

<p>"Well hit, sir! Well hit!"</p>

<p>The Eton cheering became frantic. After nearly an
hour's pawky, uninteresting play, the Eton captain suddenly
changed his tactics. His "eye" was in; now or never
let him score. A half-volley came down from the pavilion
end&mdash;a half-volley and off the wicket. The Etonian put
all the strength and power he had suppressed so manfully
into a tremendous swipe, and hit the ball clean over the
ropes.</p>

<p>"Do you want to double that bet?" said Strathpeffer
to the Caterpillar. They were standing on the top of the
Trent coach.</p>

<p>"No, thanks."</p>

<p>"Give you two to one, Egerton?"</p>

<p>"Done&mdash;in fivers."</p>

<p>The unhappy bowler sent down another half-volley.
Once more the Etonian smote, and smote hard; but this
ball was not quite the same as the first, although it appeared
identical. The ball soared up and up. Would it fall over
the ropes? Thousands of eyes watched its flight. Desmond
started to run. Golconda to a sixpence on the fall! It
is falling, falling, falling.</p>

<p>"He'll never get there in time," says Charles Desmond.</p>

<p>"Yes he will," Warde answers savagely.</p>

<p>"He has!" screamed the Rev. Septimus. "He&mdash;<i>has</i>!"</p>

<p>Pandemonium broke loose. Grey-headed men threw<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
their hats into the air; M.P.'s danced; lovely women
shrieked; every Harrovian on the ground howled. For
C&aelig;sar held the ball fast in his lean, brown hands.</p>

<p>The Eton captain walks slowly towards the pavilion.
He had to pass C&aelig;sar on his way, and passing him he
pauses.</p>

<p>"That was a glorious catch," he says, with the smile
of a gallant gentleman.</p>

<p>And as Harrow, as cordially as Eton, cheers the retiring
chieftain, the Caterpillar whispers to Mrs. Verney&mdash;</p>

<p>"Did you see that? Did you see him stop to congratulate
C&aelig;sar?"</p>

<p>"Yes," says Mrs. Verney.</p>

<p>"I hope Scaife saw it too," the Caterpillar replies
coolly. "That Eton captain is cut out of whole cloth;
no shoddy there, by Jove!"</p>

<p>And Desmond. How does Desmond feel? It is futile
to ask him, because he could not tell you, if he tried. But
we can answer the question. If the country that he wishes
to serve crowns him with all the honours bestowed upon a
favoured son, never, <i>never</i> will C&aelig;sar Desmond know again
a moment of such exquisite, unadulterated joy as this.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Six wickets down and 39 runs to get in less than half
an hour!</p>

<p>Every ball now, every stroke, is a matter for cheers,
derisive or otherwise. The Rev. Septimus need not prate
of golden days gone by. Boys at heart never change.
And the atmosphere is so charged with electricity that a
spark sets the firmament ablaze.</p>

<p><i>Seven wickets for 192.</i></p>

<p><i>Eight wickets for 197.</i></p>

<p>Signs of demoralization show themselves on both sides.
The bowling has become deplorably feeble, the batting even
more so. Four more singles are recorded. Only ten runs
remain to be made, with two wickets to fall.</p>

<p>And twelve minutes to play!<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span></p>

<p>Scaife puts on the Duffer again. The lips of the Rev.
Sep are seen to move inaudibly. Is he praying, or cursing,
because three singles are scored off his son's first three balls?</p>

<p>"Well bowled&mdash;well bowled!"</p>

<p>A ball of fair length, easy enough to play under all
ordinary circumstances, but a "teaser" when tremendous
issues are at stake, has defeated one of the Etonians. The
last man runs towards the pitch through a perfect hurricane
of howls. Warde rises.</p>

<p>"I can't stand it," he says, and his voice shakes oddly.
"You fellows will find me behind the Pavvy after the
match."</p>

<p>"I'd go with you," says the Rev. Septimus, in a choked
tone, "but if I tried to walk I should tumble down."</p>

<p>Charles Desmond says nothing. But, pray note the
expression so faithfully recorded in <i>Punch</i>&mdash;the compressed
lips, the stern, frowning brows, the protruded jaw. The
famous debater sees all fights to a finish, and fights himself
till he drops.</p>

<p><i>Seven runs to make, one wicket to fall, and five minutes to
play!!!</i></p>

<p>Evidently the last man in has received strenuous instructions
from his chief. The bowling has degenerated
into that of an&aelig;mic girls&mdash;and two whacks to the boundary
mean&mdash;Victory. The new-comer is the square, thick-set
fast bowler, the worst bat in the Eleven, but a fellow of
determination, a slogger and a run-getter against village
teams.</p>

<p>He obeys instructions to the letter. The Duffer's fifth
ball goes to the boundary.</p>

<p>Three runs to make and two and a half minutes to play!</p>

<p>The Duffer sends down the last ball. The Rev. Septimus
covers his eyes. O wretched Duffer! O thou whose knees
are as wax, and whose arms are as chop-sticks in the hands
of a Griffin! O egregious Duff! O degenerate son of a
noble sire, dost thou dare at such a moment as this to
attack thine enemy with a&mdash;long hop?<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span></p>

<p>The square, thick-set bowler shows his teeth as the ball
pitches short. Then he smites and runs. Runs, because
he has smitten so hard that no hand, surely, can stop the
whirling sphere. Runs&mdash;ay&mdash;and so does the Demon at
cover point. This is the Demon's amazing conjuring-trick&mdash;what
else can you call it? And he has practised it so
often, that he reckons failure to be almost impossible. To
those watching he seems to spring like a tiger at the ball.
By Heaven! he has stopped it&mdash;he's snapped it up! But
if he despatches it to the wicket-keeper, it will arrive too
late. The other Etonian is already within a couple of
yards of the crease. Scaife does not hesitate. He aims at
the bowler's wicket towards which the burly one is running
as fast as legs a thought too short can carry him.</p>

<p>He aims and shies&mdash;instantaneously. He shatters the
wicket.</p>

<p>"How's that?"</p>

<p>The appeal comes from every part of the ground.</p>

<p>And then, clearly and unmistakably, the umpire's fiat
is spoken&mdash;</p>

<p>"Out!"</p>

<p>The Rev. Sep rises and rushes off, upsetting chairs,
treading on toes, bent only upon being the first to tell
Warde that Harrow has won.</p>

<p>"<i>Io! Io! Io!</i>"</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The cheering</span> at Bill upon the following Tuesday must be
recorded, inasmuch as it has, indirectly, bearing upon our
story. It will be guessed that the enthusiasm, the uproar,
the tumultuous excitement were even greater than on a
similar occasion some fifteen years before. But, to his
amazement, Desmond, not Scaife, was made the particular
hero of the hour. Scaife's display of temper festered in the
hearts of boys who can forgive anything sooner than low
breeding. The Hill had seen the Etonian stop to speak his
cheery word of congratulation to C&aelig;sar, and not the Caterpillar
alone, but urchins of thirteen had made comparisons.</p>

<p>Scaife, however, could not complain of his reception
upon that memorable Tuesday afternoon; the cheering
must have been heard a mile away. But Desmond was
acclaimed differently. The cheers were no louder&mdash;that
was impossible&mdash;but afterwards, when the excitement had
simmered down, C&aelig;sar became the object of a special
demonstration by the Monitors and Sixth Form. Nearly
every boy of note in the Upper School insisted upon shaking
his hand or patting him on the back. Scaife came up with
the others, but he left the Yard almost immediately and
retired to his room. He had won the great match; Desmond
had saved it; and the School apprehended the subtle
difference. More, Scaife knew that John had gone up to
Desmond with outstretched hands after the match at Lord's.
He could hear John's eager voice, see the flame of admiration
in his eyes, as he said, "Oh, C&aelig;sar, I am glad it was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span>
you who made that catch!" And with those generous
words, with that warm clasp of the hand, Scaife had seen
the barrier which he had built between the friends dissolve
like ice in the dog-days.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The attention of the Manor was now fixed upon the
house matches. It seemed probable that with four members
of the School Eleven in the team, the ancient house
must prove invincible. But to John's surprise, as this delightful
probability ripened into conviction, Warde betrayed
unwonted anxiety and even irritability. Miss Iris confided
to Desmond, who paid her much court, that she couldn't
imagine what was the matter with papa. And mamma, it
transpired (from the same source), really feared that the
strain at Lord's had been too much, that her indefatigable
husband was about to break down. Finally, John made
up his mind to ask a question. He was second in command;
he had a right to ask the chief if anything were seriously
amiss. Accordingly, he waited upon Warde after prayers.</p>

<p>But when he put his question, and expressed, modestly
enough, his anxiety and desire to help if he could, Warde
bit his lips. Then he burst out violently&mdash;</p>

<p>"I am miserable, Verney."</p>

<p>John said nothing. His tutor rose and began to pace
up and down the study; then, halting, facing John, he
spoke quickly, with restless gestures indicating volcanic
disturbance.</p>

<p>"I'm between the devil and the deep sea," he said, "as
many a better man has been before me. I thought I'd
wiped out the grosser evils in the Manor, but I haven't&mdash;I
haven't. Do you know that a fellow in this house,
perhaps two of 'em, but one at any rate, is getting out at
night and going up to town? You needn't answer, Verney.
If you do know it, you are powerless to prevent it, or it
wouldn't occur."</p>

<p>"Thank you, sir."</p>

<p>"I can only guess who it is. I am not certain. And<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
to make certain, I must play the spy, creep and crawl, do
what I loathe to do&mdash;suspect the innocent together with the
guilty. It's almost breaking my heart."</p>

<p>"I can understand that, sir, after what you have done
for us."</p>

<p>Warde smiled grimly. "I don't think you do quite
understand," he said slowly. "At this moment I am
tempted, tempted as I never have been tempted, to let
things slide, to shut both eyes and ears, till this term is
over. Next term"&mdash;he laughed harshly&mdash;"I shan't stand
in such an awkward place. The deep sea will always be
near me, but the devil&mdash;the devil will be elsewhere."</p>

<p>John nodded. His serious face expressed neither
approval nor disapproval to the man keenly watching it.
Afterwards Warde remembered this impassivity.</p>

<p>"If I do not act"&mdash;Warde's voice trembled&mdash;"I am
damned as a traitor in my own eyes."</p>

<p>John had never doubted that his house-master would
act. As for creeping and crawling, can peaks be scaled
without creeping and crawling? Never&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>"You are not to speak a word of warning," Warde
continued vehemently. "If you know what I don't know
yet, still you cannot speak to me, because the sinner in this
case is a Sixth-Form boy. You cannot speak to me; and
you will not speak to him, on your honour?"</p>

<p>There was interrogation in the last sentence. John
replied almost inaudibly&mdash;</p>

<p>"I shall not speak&mdash;on my honour!"</p>

<p>"It is hard, hard indeed, that I should have to foul my
own nest, but it must be so. Good night."</p>

<p>John went back to his room, calm without, terribly
agitated within. What ruthless spirit had driven him to
Warde's study? Yes; at last, inexorably, discovery, disgrace,
the ineffaceable brand of expulsion, impended over
the head of his enemy, to whom he was pledged to utter no
word of warning. Like Warde, he did not know absolutely,
but he guessed that Scaife had spent another riotous night<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
in town since the match. He had read it in the eyes
glittering with excitement, in the derisive smile of conscious
power, in the magnetic audacity of Scaife's glance.
And then he remembered Lawrence's parting words&mdash;</p>

<p>"It will be a fight to a finish, and, mark me, Warde will
win!"</p>

<p>Two wretched days and nights passed. More than once
John spurred himself to the point of going to Warde and
saying, "Think what you like of me, I am going to warn
the boy I loathe that you are at his heels." Still, always
at the last moment he did not go. Some power seemed
to restrain him. But when he tried to analyse his feelings,
he confessed himself muddled. He had obtained, nay,
invited, Warde's confidence; and he dared not abuse it.
It was a time of anguish. He was unable to concentrate
his mind upon work or play, deprived of sleep, haunted by
the conviction that if Desmond knew all, he would turn
from him for ever. Then, at the most difficult moment of
his life, the way of escape was opened.</p>

<p>Since the match, John and C&aelig;sar had resumed the former
unrestrained and continual intimacy and intercourse.
John was in and out of Desmond's room, Desmond was in
and out of John's room, at all hours. They "found" together,
of course, but it is not, fortunately, at meals that
boys or men discuss the things nearest to their hearts. But
at night, just before lights were turned out, or just after,
when an Olympian is privileged to work a little longer by
the light of the useful "tolly," C&aelig;sar and Jonathan would
talk freely of past, present, and future. It was during these
much-valued minutes, or on Sunday afternoons, that John
would read to his friend the essays or verses which always
fired Desmond's admiration and enthusiasm. To John's
intellectual activities C&aelig;sar played, so to speak, gallery;
even as John upon many an afternoon had sat stewing in
the covered racquet-court, applauding Desmond's service
into the corner, or his hot returns just above the line. At
home, in the holidays, the boys had always met upon the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
same plane. Of the two, John was the better rider and
shot. Both were members of the Philathletic Club<a name="FNanchor_38_38" id="FNanchor_38_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_38" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> of
Harrow, and the fact that Desmond was incomparably his
superior as an athlete was counterbalanced by John's fine
intellectual attainments. If John, at times, wished that he
could cut behind the wicket in C&aelig;sar's faultless style,
Desmond, on the other hand, spoke enviously of the Medal,
or the Essay, or some other of John's successes. John spoke
often and well in the Debating Society, getting up his
subjects with intelligence and care. So it was give-and-take
between them, and this adjusted the balance of their
friendship, and without this no friendship can be pronounced
perfect.</p>

<p>None the less, free and delightful as this resumption of
the old intimacy had been, John knew C&aelig;sar too well not
to perceive that between them lay an unmentionable five
weeks, during which something had occurred. From signs
only too well interpreted before, John guessed that C&aelig;sar
was once more in debt to the Demon. And finally, C&aelig;sar
confessed that he had been betting, that he had won,
following Scaife's advice, and then had lost. The loss was
greater than the gain, and the difference, some five and
twenty pounds, had been sent to Scaife's bookmaker by
Scaife. As before, Scaife ridiculed the possibility of such
a debt causing his pal any uneasiness, but it chafed Desmond
consumedly.</p>

<p>Upon the Saturday of the semi-final house match, in
which the Manor had won a great victory by an innings
and twenty-three runs, John went to Desmond's room after
prayers. He noticed at once that his friend was unusually
excited. John, however, attributed this to C&aelig;sar's big
score. Success always inflamed C&aelig;sar, just as it seemed to
tranquillize John. John began to talk, but he noticed that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
C&aelig;sar was abstracted, answered in monosyllables, and
twice looked at his watch.</p>

<p>"Have you an appointment, C&aelig;sar?"</p>

<p>"No. What were you saying, Jonathan?"</p>

<p>"You look rather queer to-night."</p>

<p>"Do I?" He laughed nervously.</p>

<p>"You're not bothering over that debt?"</p>

<p>This time C&aelig;sar laughed naturally.</p>

<p>"Rather not. Why, that debt&mdash;&mdash;" He stopped.</p>

<p>"Is it paid?" said John.</p>

<p>"It will be. Don't worry!"</p>

<p>But John looked worried. He perceived that C&aelig;sar's
finely-formed hands were trembling, whenever they were
still.</p>

<p>"Harry," said he&mdash;he never called Desmond Harry except
when they were at home&mdash;"Harry, what's wrong?"</p>

<p>"Why, nothing&mdash;nothing, that is, which amounts to
anything."</p>

<p>"Harry, you are the worst liar in England. Something
is wrong. Can't you tell me? You must. I'm hanged
if I leave you till you do tell me."</p>

<p>He looked steadily at Desmond. In his clear grey eyes
were tiny, dancing flecks of golden brown, which Desmond
had seen once or twice before,&mdash;which came whenever
John was profoundly moved. The dancing flecks transformed
themselves in Desmond's fancy into sprites, the
airy creatures of John's will, imposing John's wishes and
commands.</p>

<p>"Scaife said I might tell you, if I liked."</p>

<p>"Scaife?" John drew in his breath. "Then Scaife
wanted you to tell me; I am sure of that." He felt his way
by the dim light of smouldering suspicion. If Scaife wanted
John to know anything, it was because such knowledge
must prove pain, not pleasure. John did not say this.
Then, very abruptly, Desmond continued. "You swear
that what I'm about to tell you will be regarded as sacred?"</p>

<p>"Yes."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span></p>

<p>"It is a matter which concerns Scaife and me, not you.
You won't interfere?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>"I'm going to London."</p>

<p>"<i>What?</i>"</p>

<p>"Don't look at me like that, you silly old ass! It's not&mdash;not
what you think," he laughed nervously. "I have bet
Scaife twenty-five pounds, the amount of my debt in fact,
that the bill-of-fare of to-night's supper at the Carlton
Hotel will be handed to him after Chapel to-morrow morning.
I bike up to town, and bike back. If I don't go this
Saturday, I have one more chance before the term is
over. That's all."</p>

<p>"That's all," repeated John, stupefied.</p>

<p>"If you can show me an easier way to make a 'pony,'
I'll be obliged to you."</p>

<p>"Scaife egged you on to this piece of folly?"</p>

<p>"No, he didn't."</p>

<p>"You may as well make a clean breast of it."</p>

<p>Bit by bit John extracted the facts. Behind them, of
course, stood Scaife, loving evil for evil's sake, planting
evil, gleaning evil, deliberately setting about the devil's
work. Desmond, it appeared, had persuaded Scaife not to
go to town till the Lord's match was over. Since the match
Scaife had spent two nights in London, whetting an inordinate
appetite for forbidden fruit; exciting in Desmond
also, not an appetite for the fruit itself, but for the mad excitement
of a perilous adventure. Then, when the thoughtless
"I'd like a lark of that sort" had been spoken, came the
derisive answer, "You haven't the nerve for it." And then
again the subtle leading of an ardent and self-willed nature
into the morass, Scaife pretending to dissuade a friend,
entreating him to consider the risk, urging him to go to bed,
as if he were a headstrong child. And finally Desmond's
challenge, "Bet you I have the nerve," and its acceptance,
protestingly, by the other, and permission given that John
should be told.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span></p>

<p>"And it's to-night?"</p>

<p>"I mean to have that bill-of-fare. Do you think I'd
back out now?"</p>

<p>In his mind's eye, our poor John was gazing down a long
lane with no turning at the end of it. Could he make his
friend believe that Scaife had brought this thing to pass from
no other motive than wishing to hurt mortally an enemy
by the hand of a friend? No, never would such an ingenuous
youth as C&aelig;sar accept, or even listen to, such an
abominable explanation.</p>

<p>"Good night," said John.</p>

<p>"I see you're rather sick with me, Jonathan. Remember,
you made me speak. To-morrow morning we'll have
a good laugh over it. We'll walk to the Haunted House,
and I'll tell my tale. I shall be on my way in less than an
hour."</p>

<p>John went back to his room. The necessity for silence
and thought had become imperative. What could he do?
It was certain that Warde was waiting and watching. He
had inexhaustible patience. Desmond, not the Demon,
would be caught and expelled. John returned to Desmond's
room.</p>

<p>"You've told me so much," he said; "tell me a little
more. How are you going to do it?"</p>

<p>"To do what?"</p>

<p>"Get out of the house? Get a bike&mdash;and all that?"</p>

<p>"Easy. Lovell went out that way, and others. You
jump from the sill of the first landing window into the
horse-chestnut. One must be able to jump, of course;
but I can jump. Then you shin down the tree, nip through
the shrubbery, and over the locked wicket-gate."</p>

<p>"Yes," John said slowly, "over the gate."</p>

<p>"I borrowed a bike from one of the Cycle Corps, and have
ridden it in the garden, in a bush to the right of the gate."</p>

<p>John nodded.</p>

<p>"It's moonlight after ten; I shall enjoy the ride immensely."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[219]</a></span></p>

<p>"You will try to get back into the house at night?"</p>

<p>"Too dangerous. Lovell did it; but the Demon
marches in boldly just before Chapel. He may have
slipped out on half a dozen errands as soon as the door is
opened in the morning. I shall sleep under a stack. It's
a lovely night. Now, old Jonathan, I hope you're satisfied
that I'm not either the fool or the sinner you took me to
be."</p>

<p>"Look here, Harry. If I appeal to you in the name
of our friendship; if I ask you for my sake and for my
mother's sake not to do this thing&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Jonathan, I must go. Don't make it harder than it
is."</p>

<p>"Then it <i>is</i> hard?"</p>

<p>"I won't whine about that. I courted this adventure,
and, by Jove! I'm going to see it through. The odds are
a hundred to one against my being nailed."</p>

<p>"All right; I'll say no more. Good night."</p>

<p>"Good night, old Jonathan."</p>

<p>John went back to his room, waited three minutes, and
then, in despair, made up his mind to seek Scaife. He
felt certain that the Demon's extraordinary luck was about
to stand between him and expulsion. Desmond would be
caught red-handed, but not he. John ground his teeth
with rage at the thought. He found Scaife alone&mdash;at work
on cricketing accounts.</p>

<p>"Hullo, Verney!"</p>

<p>"C&aelig;sar tells me that he is going up to London to-night."</p>

<p>"Oh, he told you that, did he?"</p>

<p>"Yes; you wished him to tell me?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps." Scaife laughed louder.</p>

<p>"You want to prove to me," said John slowly, "that
you are the stronger?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps." Scaife laughed.</p>

<p>"Well, if I surrender, if I admit that you are the stronger,
that you have defeated me, won't that be enough?"</p>

<p>"Eh? I don't quite take you."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[220]</a></span></p>

<p>"You are the stronger." John's voice was very miserable.
"I have tried to dissuade him, as you knew I
should try, and I have failed. Isn't that enough? You
have your triumph. But now be generous. Turn round
and use your strength the other way. Make him give up
this folly. You don't want to see your own pal&mdash;sacked?"</p>

<p>"Precious little chance of that!"</p>

<p>"There is the chance."</p>

<p>Scaife hesitated. Did some worthier impulse stir
within him? Who can tell? His keen eye softened, and
then hardened again.</p>

<p>"No," he said quickly. "If I agree to what you propose,
it is, after all, you who triumph, not I. And I doubt
if I could stop him now, even if I tried." He laughed
again, for the third time, savagely. "You are hoist with
your own petard, Verney. You wanted to see me sacked;
and now that there is a chance in a thousand that C&aelig;sar
will be sacked, you squirm. I swore to get my knife into
you, and, by God, I've done it."</p>

<p>John went out, very pale. He passed through into the
private side, and tapped at Warde's study door. Mrs.
Warde's voice bade him enter. She looked at John's face.
Afterwards she testified that he looked singularly cool and
self-possessed.</p>

<p>"I wish to see Mr. Warde," he said.</p>

<p>"He's dining at the Head Master's."</p>

<p>"Will he be in soon?"</p>

<p>"I&mdash;er&mdash;don't know. Perhaps not. I wouldn't wait
for him, Verney, if I were you."</p>

<p>"Thank you," said John. "Good night."</p>

<p>He went back to his room. In Mrs. Warde's eyes he
had read&mdash;what? Excitement? Apprehension? Suddenly,
conviction came to him that this dinner at the Head
Master's was a blind. Why, during that very afternoon,
Warde had mentioned casually to Scaife that he was dining
out. He had deliberately informed the Demon that the
coast was clear. And at this moment, probably, Warde<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[221]</a></span>
lay concealed near the chestnut tree, waiting, watching,
about to pounce upon the&mdash;wrong man!</p>

<p>The temptation to cry "<i>Cave!</i>" tore at his vitals. Till
this moment the tyranny of honour had never oppressed
John. Having resolved to tell Warde that he meant
to break his word, it may seem inexplicable that he
shouldn't go a step further and break his word without
warning the house-master. Upon such nice points of
conscience hang issues of world-wide importance. To
John, at any rate, the difference between the two paths out
of a tangled wood was greater than it might appear to some
of us. Warde had trusted him implicitly: could he bring
himself to violate Warde's confidence without giving the
man notice?</p>

<p>However, what he might have done under pressure
must remain a matter of surmise. At this moment a third
path became visible. And down it John rushed, without
consideration as to where it might lead. The one thing
plain at this crisis was the certainty that he had discovered
a plan of action which would save two things he valued
supremely&mdash;his friendship for C&aelig;sar and his word of
honour.</p>

<p>Here we are to liberty to speculate what John would
have done had he considered dispassionately the consequences
of an action to be accomplished at once or not at
all. But he had not time to consider anything except the
fact that action would put to rout some very tormenting
thoughts.</p>

<p>He crumpled his bed, disarranged his room, and put
on a cap and a thin overcoat, as all lights in the boys' side
of the Manor were extinguished. Then he stole out of his
room, and crept to the window at the end of the passage.
A moment later, he had squeezed through it, and was
standing upon the sill outside, gazing fearfully at the void
beneath, and the distance between the sill and the branch
in front of him. Afterwards, he confessed that this moment
was the most difficult. He was an active boy, but he had<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">[222]</a></span>
never jumped such a chasm. If he missed the bough&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>To hesitate meant shameful retreat. John felt the
sweat break upon him; craven fear clutched his heart-strings,
and set them a-jangling.</p>

<p>He jumped.</p>

<p>The ease with which he caught the branch was such a
physical relief that he almost forgot his errand. He slid
quietly down the tree, pausing as he reached the bottom of
it. The moon was just rising above the horizon, but under
the trees the darkness was Stygian. John pushed quietly
through the shrubberies, treading as lightly as possible.
Every moment he expected to see the flash of a lantern, to
hear Warde's voice, to feel an arresting hand upon the
shoulder. It was quite impossible to guess with any reasonable
accuracy what part of the garden Warde had selected
for a hiding-place. Very soon he reached the edge of the
shrubbery, and gazed keenly into the moonlit, park-like
meadow below him. Peer as he might, he could see no
trace of Warde. A dozen trees might conceal him. Perhaps
with the omniscience of the house-master, he had
divined that the wicket-gate was the ultimate place of
egress. Perhaps the wicket had been used for a similar
purpose when Warde himself was a boy at the Manor. It
was vital to John's plan that Warde should see him without
recognizing him, and give chase. The chase would end
in capture at some point as reasonably far from the Manor
as possible. Warde might ask for explanations, but none
would be forthcoming till the morrow. Meantime, the
coast would be clear for Desmond. John, in fine, was
playing the part of a pilot-engine.</p>

<p>But where was Warde?</p>

<p>The question answered itself within a minute, and after
a fashion absolutely unforeseen. As John was crossing
from the shrubbery to the wicket he looked back. To his
horror, he saw lights in the boys' side, light in the window
of Scaife's room. Instantly John divined what had come
to pass, and cursed himself for a fool. Warde, from some<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[223]</a></span>
coign of vantage, had seen a boy leave his house. Why
should he try to arrest the boy? why should he risk the
humiliation of running after him, and, perhaps, failing to
capture him? No, no; men forty were not likely to work
in that boyish fashion. Warde had adopted an infinitely
better plan. Assured that a boy had left the house, he
had nothing to do but walk round the rooms and find out
which one was absent. He had begun with Scaife. Next
to Scaife was the room belonging to the Head of the House;
then came John's room, and then C&aelig;sar's. Long before
Warde reached C&aelig;sar's room, C&aelig;sar would have heard him.
C&aelig;sar, at any rate, was saved. John crept back under
cover of the shrubberies. He saw the light flicker out of
Scaife's window, and shine more steadily in the next room.
The window of this room was open, and John could hear
the voice of Warde and the Head of the House. John
waited. And then the light shone in Desmond's room.
John crouched against the wall, trembling. If C&aelig;sar had
not heard the voices, if he were fully dressed, if&mdash;&mdash; Suddenly
he caught Warde's reassuring words: "Ah, Desmond,
sorry to disturb you. Good night."</p>

<p>John waited. Very soon Scaife would come to Desmond's
room. Ah! Just so. The night was so still that
he could hear quite plainly the boys' muffled voices.</p>

<p>"What's up?"</p>

<p>"Warde is going his rounds. Perhaps he smells a rat."</p>

<p>And then whispers! John strained his ears. Only a
word or two more reached him. "Verney&mdash;&mdash; D&mdash;&mdash;d
interfering sneak! Let's see!" It was Scaife who was
speaking.</p>

<p>John heard his own door opened and shut. Scaife,
then, had discovered his absence, and naturally leaped to
the conclusion that he had warned Warde. Let him think
so! The boys were still whispering together. "Not to-night,"
Scaife said decisively. "No, no," Desmond replied.</p>

<p>John wondered what remained to be done. Warde, of
course, would satisfy himself that no boy in his house was<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[224]</a></span>
missing except John, before he pronounced him the
absentee. Poor Warde! This would be a hard knock for
him. John's thoughts were jostling each other freely, when
he recalled Desmond's words: "I have one more chance
before the term is over." He had wished to clear the way
for his friend, not to block it. Then he remembered the
terms of the bet, and laughed.</p>

<p>He ran back to the wicket, found the bicycle, lit the
lamp, and hoisted the machine over the gate. Then he
laughed again. After all, this escaping from bondage, this
midnight adventure beneath the impending sword of
expulsion, thrilled him to the marrow.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>When John returned on Sunday to the Manor, shortly
after the doors were unlocked in the morning, he found
Dumbleton awaiting him. Dumber's face expressed such
amazement and consternation that John nearly laughed in
spite of himself.</p>

<p>"It's all hup, sir," said the butler. Only in moments
of intense excitement did Dumber misplace or leave out
the aspirate. "You're to come with me at once to Mr.
Warde's study."</p>

<p>John followed the butler into the familiar room. Warde
was not down yet, but evidently Dumber had instructions
not to leave the prisoner. John stared at the writing-desk.
Then he turned to Dumbleton, and said carelessly&mdash;</p>

<p>"This means the sack, eh, Dumber?"</p>

<p>"Yes, sir. 'Ow could you do it, sir? Such a well-be'aved
gentleman, too!"</p>

<p>"Thank you, Dumber." John took an envelope from
the desk, and wrote Scaife's name upon it.</p>

<p>"Dumber, please give Mr. Scaife this&mdash;with my compliments.
It is, as you see, a bill of fare."</p>

<p>"Very good, sir."</p>

<p>John placed the card into the envelope and handed both
to Dumbleton.</p>

<p>"With my compliments!"<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[225]</a></span></p>

<p>"Certainly, sir."</p>

<p>"And <i>after</i> Chapel."</p>

<p>"Yes, sir."</p>

<p>A moment later Warde came in. Dumbleton went out
immediately with a sorrowful, backward glance at John.
The good fellow looked terribly bewildered. For John's
face, John's deportment, had amazed him. John was
quite unaware of it, but he looked astonishingly well.
Excitement had flushed his cheek and lent a sparkle to his
grey eyes. He had enjoyed his ride to town and back;
he had slept soundly under the lee of a haystack; and he
had washed his face and hands in the horse-trough at the
foot of Sudbury Hill. And the certainty that Desmond
was safe, that in the end he, John, had triumphed over
Scaife, filled his soul with joy. Warde, on the other hand,
looked wretched; he had passed a sleepless night; he
was pale, haggard, gaunt.</p>

<p>"What have you to say, Verney?"</p>

<p>"Nothing, sir."</p>

<p>"Nothing." Warde clenched his hands, and burst into
speech, letting all that he had suffered and suppressed
escape in tumultuous words and gestures. "Nothing.
You dare to stand there and say&mdash;nothing. That you
should have done this thing! Why, it's incredible! And
I who trusted you. And you listened to me with a face
like brass, laughing in your sleeve, no doubt, at the fool
who betrayed himself. And you came here, so my wife
tells me, to see if I was out of the way, if the coast was
clear. And you were cool as a cucumber. Oh, you hypocrite,
you damnable hypocrite! I have to see you now,
but never again will I look willingly upon your face, never!
Well, this wretched business must be ended. You got out
of my house last night. You heard I was dining with the
Head Master. I returned early, and I saw you jump from
the passage window. You don't deny that you went up
to London, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"No, sir; I don't deny it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[226]</a></span></p>

<p>At the moment John, quite unconsciously, looked as
if he were glorying in what he had done. Warde could
have struck his clean, clear face, unblushingly meeting his
furious glance. In disgust, he turned his back and walked
to the window. John felt rather than saw that his tutor
was profoundly moved. When he turned, two tears were
trickling down his cheeks. The sight of them nearly undid
John. When Warde spoke again, his voice was choked
by his emotion.</p>

<p>"Verney," he said, "I spoke just now in an unrestrained
manner, because you&mdash;you"&mdash;his voice trembled&mdash;"have
shaken my faith in all I hold most dear. I say to you&mdash;I
say to you that I believed in you as I believe in my wife.
Even now I feel that somehow there is a mistake&mdash;that you
are not what you confess yourself to be&mdash;a brazen-faced
humbug. You have worked as I have worked for this
House, and in one moment you undo that work. Have
you paused to think, what effect this will have upon the
others?"</p>

<p>"Not yet, sir."</p>

<p>John looked respectfully sympathetic. Poor Warde!
This was rough indeed upon him.</p>

<p>Suddenly the door was flung open, and Desmond burst
into the room, with a complete disregard of the customary
proprieties, and rushed up to Warde.</p>

<p>"Sir," he said vehemently, "Verney did this to save&mdash;<i>me</i>!"</p>

<p>Warde saw the slow smile break upon John's face.
And, seeing it, he came as near hysterical laughter as a
man of his character and temperament can come. He
perceived that John, for some amazing reason, had played
the scape-goat; that, in fact, he was innocent&mdash;not a
humbug, not a hypocrite, not a brazen-faced sinner.
And the relief was so stupendous that the tutor flung himself
back into a chair, gasping. Desmond spoke quietly.</p>

<p>"I was going to town, sir. For the first time, I swear.
And only to win a bet, and for the excitement of jumping<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[227]</a></span>
out of a window. John tried to dissuade me. When he
exhausted every argument, he went himself."</p>

<p>"The Lord be praised!" said Warde. He had divined
everything; but he let Desmond tell the story in detail.
Scaife's name was left out of the narrative.</p>

<p>Then Warde said slowly, "I shall not refer this business
to the Head Master; I shall deal with it myself. For
your own sake, Desmond, for the sake of your father, and,
above all else, for the sake of this House, I shall do no
more than ask you to promise that, for the rest of your
time at Harrow, you will endeavour to atone for what has
been."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>All boys worth their salt are creatures of reserves;
let us respect them. It is easy to surmise what passed
between the friends&mdash;the gratitude, the self-reproach, the
humiliation on one side; the sympathy, the encouragement
and shy, restrained affection on the other. A bitter-sweet
moment for John this, revealing, without disguise, the
weakness of Desmond's character, but illuminating the
triumph over Scaife, the all-powerful. John had been
inhuman if this knowledge had not been as spikenard to
him.</p>

<p>Chapel over, the boys came pouring back into the
house. In a minute the fags would be hurrying up with the
tea and the jam-pots, asking for orders; in a minute Scaife
would rush in with questions hot upon his lips. John
chuckled to himself as he heard Scaife's step.</p>

<p>"Hullo, C&aelig;sar! Why did you cut Chapel? And&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>John saw that the Carlton supper-card was in his hand.
He chuckled again.</p>

<p>"Dumber has just given me&mdash;<i>this</i>. Did you go, after
all?" he asked C&aelig;sar. They had not met since Warde's
visit of the night before.</p>

<p>"I didn't go," said C&aelig;sar.</p>

<p>"Dumber gave it to me, with Verney's compliments."</p>

<p>"You've lost your bet," said John.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[228]</a></span></p>

<p>"But how?"</p>

<p>"Jonathan went to town instead of me," said Desmond.
"We thought he was with Warde&mdash;he wasn't. This
morning, early, I found out that he hadn't slept in his bed.
I saw him come back, and I saw Dumber waiting for him.
When Dumber came out of Warde's room, he told me that
Jonathan had been up to town, and was going to be&mdash;sacked."</p>

<p>He blurted out the rest of the story, to which Scaife
listened attentively. When Desmond finished, there was
a pause.</p>

<p>"You're devilish clever," said Scaife to John.</p>

<p>"I shall pay up the pony," said Desmond.</p>

<p>"No, you won't," said Scaife. "As for the money, I
never cared a hang about that. I'm glad&mdash;and you ought
to know it&mdash;that you've won the bet. All the same,
Verney isn't entitled to all the glory that you give him."</p>

<p>"He is, he is&mdash;and more, too."</p>

<p>Scaife laughed. John felt rather uncomfortable. Always
Scaife exhibited his amazing resource at unexpected
moments.</p>

<p>"Never mind," Scaife continued, "I won't burst the
pretty bubble. And I admit, remember, Verney's cleverness."</p>

<p>He was turning to go, but Desmond clutched his sleeve.
When he spoke his fair face was scarlet.</p>

<p>"You sneer at the wrong man and at the wrong time,"
he said angrily, "and you talk as though I was a fool.
Well, I am a fool, perhaps, and I blow bubbles. Prick
this one, if you can. I challenge you to do it."</p>

<p>Scaife shrugged his shoulders. "It's so obvious," he
said coolly, "that your kind friend ran no risks other than
a sprained ankle or a cold."</p>

<p>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p>"He was certain that you would come forward. He
forced your hand. There was never the smallest chance of
his being sacked, and he knew it."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[229]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes," said John, calmly, "I knew it."</p>

<p>"Just so," said Scaife. He went out whistling.</p>

<p>Desmond had time to whisper to John before the fags
called them to breakfast in John's room&mdash;</p>

<p>"I say, Jonathan, I'm glad you knew that I wouldn't
fail you. As the Demon says, you are clever; you are a
sight cleverer than he is."</p>

<p>John shook his head. "I'm slow," he said. "As a
matter of fact, the thought that you would come to the
rescue never occurred to me till I was biking back from
town."</p>

<p>"Anyway, you saved me from being sacked, and as
long as I live I&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Come on to breakfast," said John.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">The last</span> Saturday of the summer term saw the Manor
cock-house at cricket: almost a foregone conclusion, and
therefore not particularly interesting to outsiders. During
the morning Scaife gave his farewell "brekker"<a name="FNanchor_39_39" id="FNanchor_39_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_39" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> at the
Creameries; a banquet of the Olympians to which John
received an invitation. He accepted because Desmond
made a point of his so doing; but he was quite aware that
beneath the veneer of the Demon's genial smile lay implacable
hatred and resentment. The breakfast in itself struck
John as ostentatious. Scaife's father sent quails, <i>&agrave; la
Lucullus</i>, and other delicacies. Throughout the meal the
talk was of the coming war. At that time most of the
Conservative papers pooh-poohed the possibility of an appeal
to arms, but Scaife's father, admittedly a great authority
on South African affairs, had told his son a fight was inevitable.
More, he and his friends were already preparing to
raise a regiment of mounted infantry. At breakfast Scaife
announced this piece of news, and added that in the event
of hostilities he would join this regiment, and not try to
pass into Sandhurst. And he added that any of his friends
who were present, and over eighteen years of age, were<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[231]</a></span>
cordially invited to send in their names, and that he
personally would do all that was possible to secure them
billets. The words were hardly out of his mouth, when
C&aelig;sar Desmond was on his feet, with an eager&mdash;</p>

<p>"Put me down, Demon; put me down first!"</p>

<p>And then Scaife glanced at John, as he answered&mdash;</p>

<p>"Right you are, C&aelig;sar, and if things go well with us, I
fancy that we shall get our commissions in regular regiments
soon enough. The governor had had a hint to that effect.
Let's drink success to 'Scaife's Horse.'"</p>

<p>The toast was drunk with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>During the holidays, John saw nothing of Desmond,
although they wrote to each other once a week. John was
reading hard with an eye to a possible scholarship at
Oxford; Desmond was playing cricket with Scaife. Later,
Desmond went to the Scaife moor in Scotland. John noted
that his friend's letters were full of two things only: sport,
and the ever-increasing probability of war. At the end of
August John Verney, the explorer, returning to Verney
Boscobel after an absence of nearly four years, began to
write his now famous book on the Far East. Then John
learned from his mother that his uncle had borne all the
charges of his education. When he thanked him, the uncle
said warmly&mdash;</p>

<p>"You have more than repaid me, my dear boy; not
another word, please, about that. Warde tells me they
expect great things of you at Oxford."</p>

<p>Uncle and nephew were alone, after dinner. John had
noticed that the hardships endured in Manchuria and
Thibet had left scars upon the traveller. His hair was white,
he looked an old man; one whose wanderings in wild places
must perforce come soon to an end.</p>

<p>"Uncle," said John, "I want to chuck Oxford."</p>

<p>"Eh?"</p>

<p>"I should like to go into the Army."</p>

<p>"Bless my soul!"</p>

<p>The explorer eyed his nephew with wrinkled brow.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[232]</a></span>
John gave reasons; we can guess what they were. The
prospect of war had set all ardent souls afire.</p>

<p>"I must think this over, my boy," the uncle replied
presently. "I must sleep on it. Have you told your
mother?"</p>

<p>"No; I counted upon you to persuade her."</p>

<p>"Um. Now tell me about Lord's! Ah! I'm sorry I
missed that match."</p>

<p>Next day, his uncle said nothing of what lay next to
John's heart, but the pair rode together over the estate.
During that ride it became plain to the young man that
his uncle had no intention of settling down. Once or twice,
in the driest, most matter-of-fact tone, the elder spoke as
if his heir were likely to inherit soon. Finally, John blurted
out a protest&mdash;</p>

<p>"But, uncle, you are a strong man. Why do you talk
as if&mdash;as if&mdash;&mdash;" the boy couldn't finish the phrase.</p>

<p>"Tut, tut," said the uncle. "I know what I know";
and he fell into silence.</p>

<p>Not till the evening, after Mrs. Verney had gone to
bed, did the man of many wanderings speak freely.</p>

<p>"John," said he, quietly, "I have a story to tell you.
Years ago, your father and I fell in love with the same girl.
She married the better man." He paused to fill a pipe:
John saw that his uncle's fingers trembled slightly; but his
voice was cool, measured, almost monotonous. "I made
my first expedition to Patagonia. When I came back you
were just born; and I asked that I might be your godfather.
I went to Africa after the christening. And six years later
your father died. I think he had the purest and most
unselfish love of the poor and helpless that I have ever
known. He wore away his life in the service of the outcast
and forlorn. And before he died, he expressed a wish that
you should work as he did, for others, but not in precisely
the same way. He knew, none better, the limitations
imposed upon a parson. He prayed that you might labour
in a field larger than one parish. And I promised him that<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[233]</a></span>
I would do what I could when the time came. It has come&mdash;to-night.
In my opinion, in Warde's opinion, in your
dear mother's opinion, Parliament is the place for you.
You will be sufficiently well off. Take all Oxford can give
you, and then try for the House of Commons. Charles
Desmond will make you one of his Private Secretaries. I
have spoken to him. You have a great career before you."</p>

<p>"But if war breaks out, uncle&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"War <i>will</i> break out. Don't misunderstand me! If
you are wanted out there, and the thing is going to be
very serious, if you are wanted, you must go; but decidedly
you are not wanted yet. And you are an only son; all
your mother has. John, you must think of her, and you
will think of her, I know."</p>

<p>The conviction in his quiet voice communicated itself to
his nephew. There was a pause of nearly a minute; and
then John answered, in a voice curiously like his uncle's&mdash;</p>

<p>"All right."</p>

<p>Verney senior held out his hand. "I knew you would
say that," he murmured.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>On the 18th of September, when John returned to the
Hill, the country had just learned that the proposals of the
Imperial Government to accept the note of August 19th
(provided it were not encumbered by conditions which
would nullify the intention to give substantial representation
to the Uitlanders) had not been accepted. That this
meant war, none, least of all a schoolboy, doubted. Desmond
could talk of nothing else. He told John that his
father had promised to let him leave Harrow before the end
of the term, if war were declared. The Demon, so John was
informed, had made already preparations. He was taking
out his three polo ponies, and had hopes of being appointed
Galloper to a certain General. Scaife's Horse was being
organized, but in any case would not take the field before
several months had elapsed; the Demon intended to be on
the spot when the first shot was fired.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[234]</a></span></p>

<p>To all this gunpowder-talk John listened with envious
ears and a curious sinking of the heart. He had looked
forward to having Desmond to himself; and lo! his friend
was seven thousand miles away&mdash;on the veldt, not on the
Hill.</p>

<p>"You are not keen," said Desmond.</p>

<p>On the day of the Goose Match, Saturday, September
30th, Scaife came down to Harrow to take leave of his
friends. Already, John noted an extraordinary difference
in his manner and appearance. He treated John to a
slightly patronizing smile, called him Jonathan, asked if he
could be of service to him, and posed most successfully as
a sort of sucking Alexander.</p>

<p>That he absorbed Desmond's eyes and mind was indisputable.
Everything outside South Africa, and in
particular the Hill and all things thereon, dwindled into
insignificance. Scaife made Desmond a present of the
very best maps obtainable, and nailed them on the wall
above the mantelpiece, pulling down a fine engraving
which John had given to Desmond about a year before.
Desmond uttered no protest. The engraving was bundled
out of sight behind a sofa.</p>

<p>And after Scaife's departure, Desmond talked of him
continually, and always with enthusiasm. Warde added
a note or two to the chorus.</p>

<p>"This is an opportunity for Scaife," he told John.
"He may distinguish himself very greatly, and the discipline
of the camp will transmute the bad metal into gold.
War is an alchemist."</p>

<p>Upon the 11th of October war was declared.</p>

<p>After that, Desmond became as one possessed. He
went about saying that he pitied his father profoundly
because he was a civilian and a non-combatant. Warde
wrote to Charles Desmond: "If you mean to send Harry
out, send him at once. He's fretting himself to fiddle-strings,
doing no work, and causing others to do no work
also."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[235]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir William Symons' victory and death followed, and
then the mortifying retreat of General Yule. Upon the
30th day of the month eight hundred and fifty officers and
men were isolated and captured. Who does not remember
the wave of passionate incredulity that swept across the
kingdom when the evil tidings flashed over-seas? But
Buller and his staff were on the <i>Dunottar Castle</i>, and all
Harrovians believed devoutly that within a month of
landing the Commander-in-Chief would drive the invaders
back and conquer the Transvaal.</p>

<p>Day after day, Desmond importuned his father. The
"fun" would be over, he pointed out, before he got there&mdash;and
so on. At last word came. A billet had been obtained.
Desmond received a long envelope from the War
Office. He showed it to all his friends, old and young.
Duff junior&mdash;C&aelig;sar's fag&mdash;became so excited that he asked
Warde for permission to enlist as a drummer-boy. The
School cheered C&aelig;sar at four Bill.</p>

<p>And then came the parting.</p>

<p>C&aelig;sar was to join the Headquarters' Staff as soon as
possible. He spent the last hours with John, but his mind,
naturally enough, was concentrated upon his kit. He
chattered endlessly of saddlery, revolvers, sleeping bags,
and Zeiss glasses. John packed his portmanteau. And
on the morrow the friends parted at the station without a
word beyond&mdash;</p>

<p>"Good-bye, old Jonathan. Wish you were coming."</p>

<p>"Good-bye, C&aelig;sar. Good luck!"</p>

<p>And then the shrill whistle, the inexorable rolling of the
wheels, the bright, eager face leaning far out of the window,
the waved handkerchief, the last words: "So long!" and
John's reply, "So long!"</p>

<p>John saw the face fade; the wheels of the vanishing
train seemed to have rolled over his heart; the scream of
the engine was the scream of anguish from himself. He
left the station and ran to the Tower. There, after the first
indescribable moments, some kindly spirit touched him.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[236]</a></span>
He became whole. But he had ceased to be a boy. Alone
upon the tower he prayed for his friend, prayed fervently
that it might be well with him, now and for ever&mdash;Amen.</p>

<p>When he returned to the Manor, however, peace seemed
to forsake him. The horrible gap, ever-widening, between
himself and Desmond might, indeed, be bridged by prayer,
but not by the shouts of boys and the turmoil of a Public
School.</p>

<p>During the rest of the term he worked furiously. Desmond
was now on the high seas, whither John followed him
at night and on Sundays. Warde, guessing, perhaps, what
was passing in John's heart, talked much of Desmond,
always hopefully. From Warde, John learned that Charles
Desmond had tried to dissuade his favourite son from
becoming a soldier.</p>

<p>"He wanted him to go into Parliament," said Warde.</p>

<p>John nodded.</p>

<p>"It was a disappointment. Yes; a great disappointment.
Harry would have made a debater. Yes; yes;
a nimble wit, an engaging manner, and the gift of the gab.
And the father would have had him under his own eye."</p>

<p>"But he wanted to go to South Africa from the beginning."</p>

<p>"You wanted to go," said Warde; "your uncle told me
so. It was a greater thing for you, John, to stand aside."</p>

<p>And then John put a question. "Do you think that
Harry ought to have stood aside too?"</p>

<p>Warde, however, unwilling to commit himself, spoke of
Harry's ardour and patriotism. But at the end he let fall a
straw which indicated the true current of his thoughts&mdash;</p>

<p>"Mr. Desmond is very lonely."</p>

<p>John swooped on this.</p>

<p>"Then you think, you <i>do</i> think, that Harry should have
stayed behind?"</p>

<p>"Perhaps. One hesitates to accuse the boy of anything
more than thoughtlessness."</p>

<p>"If he wished to serve his country," began John, warmly.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[237]</a></span></p>

<p>Warde smiled. "Yes, yes," he assented. "Let us
believe that, John; but there has been too much cheap
excitement."</p>

<p>Dark days followed. Who will ever forget Stormberg
and Magersfontein? A pall seemed to hang over the
kingdom. Ladysmith remained in the grip of the invader;
the Boers were not yet driven out of Natal. Meantime
C&aelig;sar had reached Sir Redvers Buller. A letter to his
father, describing the few incidents of the voyage out, and
his arrival in South Africa, was sent on to John and received
by him on the 1st of February. "John will understand,"
said C&aelig;sar, in a postscript, "that I have little time for
writing." But John did not understand. He wrote
regularly to Desmond; no answer came in return.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>At the end of the Christmas holidays John returned to
Harrow. He was now Head of his House, and very nearly
Head of the School. The weeks went by slowly. Soon, he
and a few others would travel to Oxford for their examination;
there would be the strenuous excitement of competition,
and the final announcement of success or failure.
To all this John told himself that he was lukewarm.
Nothing seemed to matter since he had lost sight of C&aelig;sar's
face, since the train whirled his friend out of his life. But
he worked hard, so hard that the Head Master bade him
beware of a breakdown.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The hour of triumph came. John had gratified his own
and Warde's ambition; he was a Scholar of Christ Church.
And this well-earned success seemed to draw something in
his heart. The congratulations, the warm hand-clasps, the
generous joy of schoolfellows not as fortunate, restored his
moral circulation. A whole holiday was granted in honour
of his success at Oxford. He told himself that now he
would take things easy and enjoy himself. The clouds in
South Africa were lifting, everybody said the glorious end
was in sight. And so far Desmond had escaped wounds<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[238]</a></span>
and sickness. He had received a commission in Beauregard's
Irregular Horse; in the five days' action about
Spion Kop he behaved with conspicuous gallantry. Scaife,
having obtained his billet of Galloper, was with a General
under Lord Methuen.</p>

<p>On the last Monday but one in the term, John was
entering the Manor just before lock-up, when a Sixth Form
boy from another house passed him, running.</p>

<p>"Have you heard about poor Scaife?" he called out.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;what?"</p>

<p>"Warde will tell you; he knows." The boy ran on,
not wishing to be late.</p>

<p>John ran, too, with his heart thumping against his side.
He felt certain, from the expression upon the boy's face,
that Scaife was dead. And John recalled with intense
bitterness and humiliation moments in past years when he
had wished that Scaife would die. Charles Desmond had
told him only three weeks before that his Harry hoped to
join the smart cavalry regiment in which a commission had
been promised to Scaife. At that moment John was
sensible of an inordinate desire for anything that might
come between this wish and its fulfilment. And now, Scaife
might be lying dead.</p>

<p>He found Warde in his study staring at a telegram. He
looked up as John entered, and in silence handed him the
message.</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Demon dead. Died gloriously.</i>"</p>

<p>The telegram came from an Harrovian, an old Manorite
at the War Office.</p>

<p>John sat down, stunned by the news; Warde regarded
him gravely. John met his glance and could not interpret
it. Presently, Warde said nervously&mdash;</p>

<p>"Why did the fellow write 'Demon' instead of 'Scaife'?
I don't like that." He looked sharply at John, who did
not understand. Then he added, "I've wired for confirmation.
There may be a&mdash;mistake."<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[239]</a></span></p>

<p>"What mistake?" said John. Warde's manner confused
him, frightened him. "What mistake, sir?"</p>

<p>Warde, twisting the paper, answered miserably&mdash;</p>

<p>"There has been an action, but not in Scaife's part of
Africa. Beauregard's Horse were engaged and suffered
severely. And would any one say 'Demon' in such a
serious context?"</p>

<p>"Oh, my God!" said John, pale and trembling. At
last he understood. Add two letters to "Demon" and you
have "Desmond." How easily such a mistake could be
made!&mdash;"Desmond," ill-written, handed to an old Manorite
to copy and despatch.</p>

<p>"It's Scaife&mdash;it's Scaife," John cried.</p>

<p>Warde said nothing, staring at the thin slip of paper
as if he were trying to wrest from it its secret.</p>

<p>"Everybody called him 'Demon,'" said John.</p>

<p>"Still, one ought to be prepared."</p>

<p>For many hideous minutes they sat there, silent, waiting
for the second telegram. Dumbleton brought it in, and
lingered, anxiously expectant; but Warde dismissed him
with a gesture. As the door closed, Warde stood up.</p>

<p>"If our fears are well founded," he said solemnly, "may
God give you strength, John Verney, to bear the blow."</p>

<p>Then he tore open the envelope and read the truth&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">"<i>Henry Desmond killed in action.</i>"</p>

<p>"No," said John, fiercely. "It is Scaife, Scaife!"</p>

<p>Warde shook his head, holding John's hand tight between
his sinewy fingers. John's face appalled him. He
had known, he had guessed, the strength of John's feeling
for Desmond, but, he had not known the strength of John's
hatred of Scaife. And Desmond had been taken&mdash;and
Scaife left. The irony of it tore the soul.</p>

<p>"Don't speak," commanded Warde.</p>

<p>John closed his lips with instinctive obedience. When
he opened them again his face had softened; the words fell
upon the silence with a heartrending inflection of misery.<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[240]</a></span></p>

<p>"And now I shall never know&mdash;I shall never know."</p>

<p>He broke down piteously. Warde let the first passion
of grief spend itself; then he asked John to explain. The
good fellow saw that if John could give his trouble words
it would be lightened enormously. He divined what had
been suppressed.</p>

<p>"What is it that you will never know, John?"</p>

<p>At that John spoke, laying bare his heart. He gave
details of the never-ending struggle between Scaife and
himself for the soul of his friend; gave them with a clearness
of expression which proved beyond all else how his thoughts
had crystallized in his mind. Warde listened, holding
John's hand, gripping it with sympathy and affection.
The romance of this friendship stirred him profoundly;
the romance of the struggle for good and evil; a struggle
of which the issues remained still in doubt; a romance
which Death had cruelly left unfinished&mdash;this had poignant
significance for the house-master.</p>

<p>"I shall never know now," John repeated, in conclusion.</p>

<p>"But you have faith in your friend."</p>

<p>"He never wrote to me," said John.</p>

<p>At last it was out, the thorn in his side which had tormented
him.</p>

<p>"If he had written," John continued, "if only he had
written once. When we parted it was good-bye&mdash;just that,
nothing more; but I thought he would write, and that
everything would be cleared up. And now, silence."</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>The week wore itself away. A few details were forthcoming:
enough to prove that a glorious deed had been
done at the cost of a gallant life. England was thrilled
because the hero happened to be the son of a popular
Minister. The name of Desmond rang through the Empire.
John bought every paper and devoured the meagre lines
which left so much between them. It seemed that a certain
position had to be taken&mdash;a small hill. For the hundredth
time in this campaign too few men were detailed for the<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[241]</a></span>
task. The reek of that awful slaughter on Spion Kop was
still strong in men's nostrils. Beauregard and his soldiers
halted at the foot of the hill, halted in the teeth of a storm
of bullets. Then the word was given to attack. But the
fire from invisible foes simply exterminated the leading
files. The moment came when those behind wavered and
recoiled. And then Desmond darted forward&mdash;alone,
cheering on his fellows. They were all afoot. The men
rallied and followed. But they could not overtake the
gallant figure pressing on in front. He ran&mdash;so the Special
Correspondent reported&mdash;as if he were racing for a goal.
The men staggered after him, aflame with his ardour.
They reached the top, captured the guns, drove down the
enemy, and returned to the highest point to find their leader&mdash;shot
through the heart, and dead, and smiling at death.
Of all the men who passed through that blizzard of bullets
he was the youngest by two years.</p>

<p>Warde told John that the Head Master would preach
upon the last Sunday evening of the term, with special
reference to Harry Desmond. Could John bear it? John
nodded. Since the first breakdown in Warde's study, his
heart seemed to have turned to ice. His religious sense,
hitherto strong and vital, failed him entirely. He abandoned
prayer.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Evensong was over in Harrow Chapel. The Head
Master, stately in surplice and scarlet hood, entered the
pulpit, and, in his clear, calm tones, announced his text,
taken from the 17th verse of the First Chapter of the Book
of Ruth&mdash;</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"The Lord do so to me, and more also, if ought but
death part thee and me."</p>

<p>The subject of the sermon was "Friendship:" the
heart's blood of a Public School: Friendship with its
delights, its perils, its peculiar graces and benedictions.</p>

<p>"To-night," concluded the preacher, amid the breathless<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[242]</a></span>
silence of the congregation, "this thought of Friendship has
for us a special solemnity. It is consecrated by the
memory of one whom we have just lost. You, who are
leaving the school, have been the friends and contemporaries
of Henry Julius Desmond; his features are fresh
in your memories, and will remain fresh as long as you
live.</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 19em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Tall, eager, a face to remember,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A flush that could change as the day;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">A spirit that knew not December,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That brightened the sunshine of May."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>"Those lines, as you know, were written of another
Harrovian, who died here on this Hill. Henry Desmond
died on another hill, and died so gloriously that the shadow
of our loss, dark as it seemed to us at first, is already melting
in the radiance of his gain. To die young, clean, ardent;
to die swiftly, in perfect health; to die saving others from
death, or worse&mdash;disgrace&mdash;to die scaling heights; to die
and to carry with you into the fuller, ampler life beyond,
untainted hopes and aspirations, unembittered memories,
all the freshness and gladness of May&mdash;is not that cause
for joy rather than sorrow? I say&mdash;yes. Henry Desmond
is one stage ahead of us upon a journey which we all must
take, and I entreat you to consider that, if we have faith
in a future life, we must believe also that we carry hence
not only the record of our acts, whether good or evil, but the
memory of them; and that memory, undimmed by falsehood
or self-deception, will create for us Heaven or Hell.
I do not say&mdash;God forbid!&mdash;that you should desire death
because you are still young, and, comparatively speaking,
unspotted from the world; but I say I would sooner see
any of you struck down in the flower of his youth than
living on to lose, long before death comes, all that makes
life worth the living. Better death, a thousand times, than
gradual decay of mind and spirit; better death than faithlessness,
indifference, and uncleanness. To you who are
leaving Harrow, poised for flight into the great world of<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[243]</a></span>
which this school is the microcosm, I commend the memory
of Henry Desmond. It stands in our records for all we
venerate and strive for: loyalty, honour, purity, strenuousness,
faithfulness in friendship. When temptation assails
you, think of that gallant boy running swiftly uphill,
leaving craven fear behind, and drawing with him the
others who, led by him to the heights, made victory
possible. You cannot all be leaders, but you can follow
leaders; only see to it that they lead you, as Henry Desmond
led the men of Beauregard's Horse, onward and
upward."</p>

<p>The preacher ended, and then followed the familiar
hymn, always sung upon the last Sunday evening of the
term:&mdash;</p>

<div class="cpoem" style="width: 18em;"><div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<span class="i0">"Let Thy father-hand be shielding<br /></span>
<span class="i2">All who here shall meet no more;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">May their seed-time past be yielding<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Year by year a richer store;<br /></span>
<span class="i4">Those returning,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Make more faithful than before."<br /></span>
</div></div></div>

<p>The last blessing was pronounced, and with glistening
eyes the boys streamed out of Chapel; some of them for the
last time.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>Upon the next Tuesday, John travelled down into the
New Forest. April was abroad in Hampshire; the larches
already were bright green against the Scotch firs; the beech
buds were bursting; only the oaks retained their drab
winter's-livery.</p>

<p>During the few days preceding Easter Sunday, John
rode or walked to every part of the forest which he had
visited in company with his dead friend. At Beaulieu,
standing in the ruins of the Abbey, he could hear Desmond's
delightful laugh as he recited the misadventures of
Hordle John; at Stoneycross he sat upon the bank overlooking
the moor, whence they had seen the fox steal into
the woods about Rufus's Stone; at the Bell tavern at<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[244]</a></span>
Brook they had lunched; at Hinton Admiral they had
played cricket.</p>

<p>To his mother's and his uncle's silent sympathy John
responded but churlishly. His friend had departed without
a word, without a sign; that ate into John's heart and
consumed it. For the first time since he had been confirmed,
he refused to receive the Sacrament. He went to
church as a matter of form; but he dared not approach the
altar in his present rebellious mood.</p>

<p>Again and again he accused himself of having yielded to
a craven fear of offending Desmond by speech too plain.
Always he had been so terribly afraid of losing his friend;
and now he had lost him indeed. This poignancy of grief
may be accounted for in part by the previous long-continued
strain of overwork. And it is ever the habit of
those who do much to think that they might have done
more.</p>

<p>At the beginning of May, John came back to the Hill,
for his last term. Out of the future rose the "dreaming
spires" of Oxford; beyond them, vague and shadowy, the
great Clock-tower of Westminster, keeping watch and ward
over the destinies of our Empire.</p>

<p>In a long letter from Charles Desmond, the Minister
had spoken of the secretaryship to be kept warm for him,
of the pleasure and solace the writer would take in seeing
his son's best friend in the place where that son might have
stood.</p>

<p>His best friend? Was that true?</p>

<p>The question tormented John. Because C&aelig;sar had been
so much to him, he desired, more passionately than he had
desired anything in his life, the assurance that he had been
something&mdash;not everything, only something&mdash;to C&aelig;sar.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>One day, about the middle of the month, John had been
playing cricket, the game of all games which brought
C&aelig;sar most vividly to his mind. Then, just before six Bill,
he strolled up the Hill and into the Vaughan Library, where<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[245]</a></span>
so many relics dear to Harrovians are enshrined. Sitting
in the splendid window which faces distant Hampstead,
John told himself that he must put aside the miseries and
perplexities of the past month. Had he been loyal to his
friend's memory? Would not a more ardent faith have
burned away doubt?</p>

<p>John gazed across the familiar fields to the huge city on
the horizon. Soon night would fall, darkness would
encompass all things. And then, out of the mirk, would
shine the lamps of London.</p>

<p>Warde's voice put his thoughts to instant flight. Some
intuition told John that something had happened. Warde
said quietly&mdash;</p>

<p>"A letter has come for you in Harry Desmond's handwriting."</p>

<p>John, unable to speak, stretched out his hand.</p>

<p>"Take it," said Warde, "to some quiet spot where you
cannot be disturbed."</p>

<p>John nodded.</p>

<p>"I have seen how it was with you," Warde continued,
with deep emotion, "and you have had my acute sympathy,
the more acute, perhaps, because long ago a friend went
out of my life without a sign." Warde paused. "Now,
unless my whole experience is at fault, you hold in your
hand what you want&mdash;and what you deserve."</p>

<p>Warde left the library; John put the letter into his
pocket. Where should he go? One place beckoned him.
Upon the tower, looking towards the Hill, he would read
the last letter of his friend.</p>

<p>Within half an hour he was passing through the iron
gates. He had not visited the garden since that forlorn
winter's afternoon, when he came here, alone, after bidding
Desmond good-bye. He could recall the desolation of the
scene: bleak Winter dripping tears upon the tomb of
Summer. With what disgust he had perceived the decaying
masses of vegetation, the sodden turf, the soot upon the
bare trunks of the trees. He had rushed away, fancying<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[246]</a></span>
that he heard Desmond's voice, "There is a curse on the
place."</p>

<p>Now, May had touched what had seemed dead and
hideous, and, lo! a miracle. The hawthorns shone white
against the brilliant green of the laurels; the horse-chestnuts
had&mdash;to use a fanciful expression of C&aelig;sar's&mdash;"lit their
lamps." Out of the waving grass glimmered and sparkled
a thousand wild flowers. John heard the glad <i>Fr&uuml;hlingslied</i>
of bees and birds. Then, opening his lungs, he inhaled the
life-renewing odours of earth renascent; opening his heart
he felt a spiritual essence pervading every fibre of his being.
Once more the chilled sap in his veins flowed generously.
It was well with him and well with his friend. This
conviction possessed him, remember, before he opened the
letter.</p>

<p>He ascended the tower, and broke the seal.</p>

<hr style='width: 45%;' />

<p>"I have been meaning to write to you, dear old chap,
ever since we parted; but, somehow, I couldn't bring myself
to tackle it in earnest till to-night. To-morrow, we have
a thundering big job ahead of us; the last job, perhaps, for
me. Old Jonathan, you have been the best friend a man
ever had, the only one I love as much as my own brothers&mdash;<i>and
even more</i>. It was from knowing you that I came to see
what good-for-nothing fools some fellows are. You were
always so unselfish and <i>straight!</i> and you made me feel that
I was the contrary, and that you knew it, and that I should
lose your friendship if I didn't improve a bit. So, if we
don't meet again in this jolly old world, it may be a little
comfort to you to remember that what you have done for
a very worthless pal was not thrown away.</p>

<p>"Good night, Jonathan. I'm going to turn in; we
shall be astir before daybreak. Over the veldt the stars are
shining. It's so light, that I can just make out the hill
upon which, I hope, our flag will be waving within a few
hours. The sight of this hill brings back our Hill. If I
shut my eyes, I can see it plainly, as we used to see it from<span class='pagenum'><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[247]</a></span>
the tower, with the Spire rising out of the heart of the old
school. I have the absurd conviction strong in me that,
to-morrow, I shall get up the hill here faster and easier
than the other fellows because you and I have so often run
up our Hill together&mdash;God bless it&mdash;and you! Good
night."</p>
